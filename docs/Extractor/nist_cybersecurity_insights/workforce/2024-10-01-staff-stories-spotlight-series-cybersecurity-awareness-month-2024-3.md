# Staff Stories Spotlight Series: Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024 - Jess Dickson

## L1 — Core Facts

This blog is part of NIST's Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024 Staff Stories Spotlight series, featuring Jess Dickson, an IT Standards Advisor in the Information Technology Laboratory's Office of IT Standardization at NIST. The 2024 theme is "Secure our World."

Jess Dickson began her career at the State Department, where she served overseas American citizens in crisis situations. She later transitioned into cybersecurity and privacy work as a federal government consultant before joining NIST.

Her current work integrates privacy risk management into NIST publications and international standards. She leads multilateral engagements focused on IT standardization and serves on the InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS) Executive Board. Beyond her primary portfolio, Dickson also serves on the NIST Lactation Support Group Board, advancing workplace equity and inclusion.

## L2 — Context & Background

Dickson's career trajectory from State Department crisis response work to cybersecurity and privacy standardization represents a transition from operational government service to policy and standards development. Her role focuses on ensuring privacy considerations are integrated into IT standards at both national (NIST) and international levels.

The blog is presented in Q&A format, discussing how the "Secure our World" theme resonates with cybersecurity professionals and highlighting staff backgrounds and current work areas. Her reflection on the theme emphasizes the international nature of NIST's work.

## L3 — Implications & Analysis

Dickson's key quote — "This year's theme is a reminder of the global nature of NIST's cybersecurity and privacy work—that it doesn't and shouldn't happen in a vacuum" — highlights the interconnected nature of cybersecurity and privacy standards development.

Her role in integrating privacy risk management into NIST publications reflects the evolution from treating privacy as a compliance checkbox to embedding privacy considerations into the core of IT standards development. This approach aligns with privacy-by-design principles and the recognition that privacy and security are complementary objectives.

Her leadership in multilateral IT standardization engagements and INCITS Executive Board position indicates that NIST actively participates in shaping international standards, not just developing domestic guidance. This international engagement ensures that U.S. perspectives influence global standards while also incorporating international best practices into NIST publications.

The mention of her service on the NIST Lactation Support Group Board, while not directly related to technical work, reflects institutional recognition that workplace equity and inclusion support technical excellence and employee retention in government research roles.

## L4 — Actionable Intelligence

**For Organizations Adopting NIST Frameworks:**
- Recognize that NIST publications increasingly integrate privacy risk management alongside cybersecurity
- Consider how privacy-by-design principles can be embedded in IT standardization processes
- Evaluate international standards alignment when implementing NIST guidance

**For Standards Development:**
- Privacy considerations should be integrated throughout standards development, not treated as separate requirements
- Multilateral engagement ensures standards are practical across different regulatory and cultural contexts
- International coordination reduces conflicting requirements for global organizations

**For Privacy Professionals:**
- Career paths into privacy standardization can come from diverse backgrounds including foreign service and government consulting
- Privacy risk management frameworks provide structured approaches for integrating privacy into IT systems
- International standards work requires understanding different regulatory regimes and cultural approaches to privacy

**For Policy Development:**
- Cybersecurity and privacy standards should not be developed in isolation but through international collaboration
- Standardization bodies like INCITS play crucial roles in coordinating U.S. positions on international IT standards
