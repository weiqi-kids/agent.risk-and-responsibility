# Staff Stories Spotlight Series: Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024 - Shanée Dawkins

## L1 — Core Facts

This blog is part of NIST's Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024 Staff Stories Spotlight series, featuring Dr. Shanée Dawkins, a Computer Scientist in the Visualization and Usability Group at NIST. The 2024 theme is "Secure our World."

Dr. Dawkins holds a B.S. in Computer Engineering from North Carolina A&T State University, plus M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Auburn University. She leads the Human-Centered Cybersecurity program's phishing project, which examines why people fall victim to phishing emails.

Since 2019, her team has developed the **NIST Phish Scale** — a tool that helps organizations evaluate email difficulty levels for phishing awareness training programs. This metric is now used globally to contextualize click and report rates from training exercises.

## L2 — Context & Background

Dawkins took an unconventional route into cybersecurity. Initially focused on computer engineering and technology, her studies gradually shifted toward user experience and human-computer interaction. This background made her well-suited for applied research with NIST's Usability Group, a multidisciplinary team including researchers from computer science, cognitive science, and psychology.

The blog format presents Q&A-style content about staff backgrounds, current projects, and perspectives on the cybersecurity awareness theme.

## L3 — Implications & Analysis

Dr. Dawkins' work represents a critical intersection between human factors and cybersecurity. Her emphasis that "knowledge and practice of good cybersecurity and privacy guidance are essential to protecting ourselves and others" reflects the human-centered approach to security challenges.

The **NIST Phish Scale** addresses a significant gap in phishing awareness training: the ability to objectively measure and contextualize training exercise difficulty. Global adoption of this metric indicates strong industry demand for standardized methods to evaluate security awareness program effectiveness.

Her multidisciplinary team composition (computer science, cognitive science, psychology) reflects the growing recognition that cybersecurity problems often require expertise beyond technical domains, particularly in understanding user behavior and decision-making processes.

## L4 — Actionable Intelligence

**For Security Awareness Programs:**
- Adopt NIST Phish Scale to standardize phishing simulation difficulty measurement
- Use difficulty ratings to contextualize click/report rates rather than treating all simulations as equivalent
- Consider multidisciplinary perspectives when designing security awareness initiatives

**For Cybersecurity Education:**
- Human-computer interaction and user experience backgrounds provide valuable perspectives for cybersecurity careers
- Research into user behavior can address persistent security challenges like phishing susceptibility

**For Organizations:**
- Evaluate current phishing training programs using standardized metrics
- Recognize that effective security requires understanding human decision-making, not just technical controls
