# Staff Stories Spotlight Series: Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024 - Eduardo Takamura

## L1 — Core Facts

This blog is part of NIST's Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024 Staff Stories Spotlight series, featuring Eduardo Takamura, a security researcher and member of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF) Team. The 2024 Cybersecurity Awareness Month theme is "Secure our World."

Eduardo Takamura holds a Master's degree in computer science from Johns Hopkins University and a Bachelor's from Bowie State University (Cum Laude). He is a Certified Information System Security Professional (CISSP #323245) with over 25 years of federal government experience supporting NASA and NOAA.

His team develops standards and guidelines enabling federal agencies to manage security and privacy risks. He focuses on developing testable controls for continuous monitoring and supports international security control standards development.

## L2 — Context & Background

Takamura initially pursued engineering before shifting to computer science, securing an IT position with a federal agency. His career direction toward cybersecurity was influenced by a graduate school professor teaching enterprise security and a former manager who encouraged him to pursue CISSP certification.

The blog is presented in Q&A format, discussing how the "Secure our World" theme resonates with cybersecurity professionals and highlighting staff backgrounds and current projects.

## L3 — Implications & Analysis

Takamura emphasizes that "everyone has the power to protect information" and views security as "collective efforts of IT users," not just the responsibility of IT departments. This perspective aligns with the democratization of cybersecurity awareness and the shift toward user-centric security practices.

His work on testable controls for continuous monitoring supports the ongoing evolution of federal risk management from periodic assessments to real-time security posture evaluation. The international scope of his standards development work reflects the global nature of cybersecurity challenges.

Takamura highlights how NIST's core values of perseverance, integrity, inclusivity, and excellence inform their standards development work, emphasizing the mission-driven nature of federal cybersecurity guidance.
