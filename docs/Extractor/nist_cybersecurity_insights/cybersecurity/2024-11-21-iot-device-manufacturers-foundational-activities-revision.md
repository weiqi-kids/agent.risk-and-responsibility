  In May 2020, NIST published Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers (NIST IR 8259), which describes recommended cybersecurity activities that manufacturers should consider performing before their IoT devices are sold to customers. These foundational cybersecurity activities can help manufacturers lessen the cybersecurity-related efforts needed by customers, which in turn can reduce the prevalence and severity of IoT device compromises and the attacks performed using compromised devices. In the nearly five years since this document was released, it has been published

# NIST IR 8259 Revision Initiative: Expanding IoT Cybersecurity Guidance

## 核心變化

NIST is undertaking a comprehensive revision of *Foundational Cybersecurity Activities for IoT Device Manufacturers* (NIST IR 8259), originally published in May 2020.

### 範圍擴展

**從單一裝置到完整生態系統**
- Original focus: Individual IoT devices
- Revised scope: Complete IoT product ecosystems including mobile apps, gateways, backend systems
- Rationale: Modern IoT products require holistic security across interconnected components

**技術環境區分**
- Addressing cybersecurity differences among IT, IoT, OT (Operational Technology), and IIoT (Industrial IoT) environments
- Recognition that different technology types require tailored security approaches

### 新增領域

**Risk and Threat Modeling**
- Developing clearer relationships between risk assessment and threat modeling activities
- Providing structured frameworks for manufacturers to identify and prioritize security concerns

**Emerging Technologies**
- Direct guidance on artificial intelligence applications in IoT
- Immersive technology considerations
- Addressing security challenges unique to AI-enabled IoT devices

**Product Lifecycle Considerations**
- Support lifecycle alignment: Balancing cybersecurity with device support timelines when IT and mechanical components have mismatched lifespans
- Repairability connections: Exploring how product repairability intersects with cybersecurity maintenance

## Workshop Structure

**Event Details**
- Date: December 4, 2024
- Location: NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE)
- Format: All-day event with morning presentations and afternoon breakout sessions
- Registration deadline: November 22, 2024 for in-person attendance

**Objectives**
- Gather community feedback on proposed updates
- Enable interactive discussion on emerging IoT security challenges
- Align revision with industry needs and government requirements

## Core Philosophy

The foundational activities framework aims to "help manufacturers lessen the cybersecurity-related efforts needed by customers," thereby reducing:
- Prevalence of IoT device compromises
- Severity of attacks performed using compromised devices
- Customer burden in securing IoT deployments

## Community Engagement

NIST invites feedback via **iotsecurity@nist.gov** for input on proposed updates during the early revision stages.

**分類維度**

- **category**: cybersecurity
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **enforcement_signal**: recommended
- **confidence**: 中

**詮釋說明**

This revision represents an **expansion** of existing guidance rather than a fundamental shift. The original NIST IR 8259 framework remains conceptually sound, but the scope is broadening to address ecosystem complexity, emerging technologies (AI, immersive tech), and lifecycle considerations that weren't prominent in 2020. The enforcement signal remains **recommended** (typical for NIST IR publications), maintaining the voluntary nature of manufacturer adoption while increasing comprehensiveness of security considerations.
