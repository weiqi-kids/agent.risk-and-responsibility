# IoT Advisory Board Report: Six Critical Barriers to U.S. IoT Adoption

## 報告概要

The NIST-managed IoT Advisory Board (16 members) completed a comprehensive report identifying barriers to U.S. IoT adoption and proposing 104 recommendations across six thematic areas. The report characterizes the U.S. as "in the early stages of a profound transformation" driven by IoT-enabled economic, societal, and cultural innovations.

## 六大障礙

### 1. Workforce Shortage
"Insufficient skilled workers are available to develop, integrate, deploy, operate, and maintain IoT devices, systems, and applications."

**Implication**: Talent gap constrains deployment velocity and operational capacity across the IoT lifecycle.

### 2. Supply Chain Vulnerability
IoT systems depend on chips sourced through vulnerable global supply chains, creating security risks.

**Implication**: Hardware dependencies introduce systemic risk that cannot be fully mitigated through software controls alone.

### 3. Trust Deficit
"Establishing trust in IoT requires a multi-dimensional ecosystem perspective, extending beyond cybersecurity and privacy."

**Implication**: Trust is not solely a technical problem—requires addressing governance, transparency, accountability, and stakeholder alignment.

### 4. Privacy Concerns
Privacy issues significantly undermine confidence and hinder widespread adoption.

**Implication**: Privacy-by-design must be embedded in IoT architectures, not treated as compliance afterthought.

### 5. Cybersecurity Threats
Security vulnerabilities represent a major barrier to scaled implementation.

**Implication**: Foundational security controls remain inadequate across many IoT deployments.

### 6. AI Integration Challenges
While AI is essential for unlocking IoT value, substantial obstacles must be addressed.

**Implication**: AI-IoT convergence introduces new complexity requiring specialized guidance and standards.

## 六大建議主題（104 項細項）

The Advisory Board organized recommendations into:

1. **Establish Trust**
   - Multi-dimensional ecosystem approach
   - Extends beyond technical cybersecurity and privacy controls

2. **Foster IoT-Ready Workforce**
   - Address talent shortage across full IoT lifecycle
   - Development, integration, deployment, operations, maintenance roles

3. **Advance Interoperability and Standards**
   - Enable seamless integration across heterogeneous systems
   - Reduce fragmentation through common protocols

4. **Accelerate Innovation**
   - Remove barriers to emerging use cases
   - Support experimental deployments and pilot programs

5. **Strengthen Supply Chain Integrity**
   - Address chip sourcing vulnerabilities
   - Enhance transparency and resilience

6. **Support Sector-Specific Implementation**
   - Tailor guidance to healthcare, manufacturing, smart cities, etc.
   - Recognize unique regulatory and operational contexts

**Cross-Cutting Themes**: Each recommendation area emphasizes cybersecurity, privacy, interoperability, and standards development.

## 後續步驟

**Federal Review**
- Report delivered to IoT Federal Working Group for consideration
- NIST encourages stakeholder engagement with findings

**Transformational Potential**
- Advisory Board characterizes IoT as driving "profound transformation" of economic, societal, and cultural systems
- Emphasizes urgency of addressing barriers to realize benefits

**分類維度**

- **category**: cybersecurity
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **enforcement_signal**: recommended
- **confidence**: 中

**詮釋說明**

This Advisory Board report **clarifies** the landscape of IoT adoption barriers and provides **recommended** actions rather than mandatory requirements. The enforcement signal reflects the advisory nature of the body—recommendations are delivered to the IoT Federal Working Group for consideration, not implemented as direct policy. The report's value lies in synthesizing stakeholder perspectives across 104 specific recommendations, providing a structured roadmap for voluntary adoption. Confidence is **中** (medium) as this is expert advisory guidance rather than binding regulation or finalized standards.
