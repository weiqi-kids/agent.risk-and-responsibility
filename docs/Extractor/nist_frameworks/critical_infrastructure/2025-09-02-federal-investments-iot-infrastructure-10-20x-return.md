## L1 — Rule Signal
- **rule_type**: guidance
- **issuing_body**: NIST
- **document_id**: NIST.GCR.25-059
- **status**: final

## L2 — Responsibility Structure
- **affected_roles**: Federal agencies (research funding bodies), Industry (IoT manufacturers and developers), Academic institutions (IoT research), Government policymakers (infrastructure investment)
- **shift_type**: new
- **shift_summary**: Federal agencies are identified as having structural advantages to implement comprehensive IoT infrastructure research programs with projected 10-20x ROI

## L3 — Risk Domains
- Critical infrastructure resilience
- IoT ecosystem security and interoperability
- AI-IoT integration risks
- National economic competitiveness

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence
- **new_obligations**:
  - Federal agencies to consider strategic investment in eleven identified IoT technology infrastructure domains
  - Government to leverage structural advantages for comprehensive IoT infrastructure approaches
- **evidence_requirements**:
  - Research proposals addressing identified short, medium, and long-term IoT infrastructure shortfalls
  - Investment returns documentation showing alignment with projected 10-20x ROI model
- **enforcement_signal**: recommended

## Notes
This is an economic research report (NIST GCR series) providing investment guidance rather than technical standards. The study identifies strategic research areas but does not mandate specific technical requirements. The intersection with AI systems noted in the report positions this within broader AI-IoT convergence trends.
