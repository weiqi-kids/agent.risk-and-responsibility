## Notes

- **Geography Clarification**: Document concerns Republic of Korea (South Korea), not South Africa. Original filename appears to have geographic error.
- **Category Correction**: This is a data protection/PNR data transfer authorization, not AI governance. Correct category is `data_protection`.
- **Legal Basis**: Decision authorizes negotiation mandate, not the substantive agreement itself. Future agreement will require separate legal instrument.
- **Member State Participation**: Ireland participated; Denmark did not participate in accordance with Protocol 22 on Denmark's position.
- **Fundamental Rights Framework**: Explicit reference to Charter of Fundamental Rights Articles 7 (respect for private and family life) and 8 (protection of personal data).
- **Purpose Limitation**: PNR data use strictly limited to "prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime" - not general law enforcement or administrative purposes.
