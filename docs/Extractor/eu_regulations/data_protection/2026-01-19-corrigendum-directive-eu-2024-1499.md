## Notes

**Original Directive Context**: Council Directive (EU) 2024/1499 establishes minimum standards for equality bodies across EU Member States, covering discrimination grounds including race, ethnicity, religion, belief, disability, age, and sexual orientation in employment and goods/services provision.

**Corrigendum Scope**: 16 corrections published in Official Journal L series (2026/90006), including grammatical adjustments in recitals (e.g., Recital 2, 13, 30) and articles (e.g., Article 4(4), Article 7(4)). Notable correction in Article 4(4) emphasizes "intersectional discrimination" as area requiring particular attention by equality bodies.

**Implementation Note**: Member States must transpose original Directive by 2026-12-21 (as specified in Directive 2024/1499 Article 16). This corrigendum does not alter transposition deadlines.

**Category Rationale**: Classified as data_protection due to Directive's focus on anti-discrimination standards and protection of individuals' rights, though broader implications span employment and civil rights frameworks.
