## Notes

This is an administrative Council Decision appointing a replacement member to the Advisory Committee on freedom of movement for workers, following the resignation of the previous Swedish government representative. The decision is based on Regulation (EU) No 492/2011 which establishes the Committee's composition and functions. The appointment fills a vacant seat for the remainder of the current term ending September 2026.

The Advisory Committee provides opinions on freedom of movement for workers within the EU, an area that intersects with digital platform labor markets and cross-border remote work arrangements, justifying classification under digital_market category despite being primarily a labor mobility governance matter.
