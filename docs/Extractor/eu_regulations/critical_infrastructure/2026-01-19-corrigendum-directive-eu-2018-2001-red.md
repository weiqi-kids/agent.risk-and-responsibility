## Notes

This document is categorized as critical_infrastructure because Directive 2018/2001 addresses renewable energy systems which constitute critical infrastructure for EU energy security and climate objectives. While the corrigendum itself only makes textual corrections, it affects a directive governing critical energy infrastructure.

The primary substantive change is terminology standardization from "marktdeelnemers" (market participants) to "economische actor" (economic actor), which may broaden or clarify the scope of covered entities under the directive's obligations.

Organizations should assess whether the terminology change affects their interpretation of obligations under Articles 23 (guarantees of origin), 27 (renewable energy in heating and cooling), 28 (renewable energy in transport), and 30 (sustainability and greenhouse gas emissions saving criteria).
