## Notes
This regulation represents a major shift in EU energy policy, mandating the phase-out of Russian natural gas imports with strict deadlines. The regulation amends Regulation (EU) 2017/1938 on gas supply security. Member States with limited alternative infrastructure (particularly in Central and Eastern Europe) face significant compliance challenges. The prior authorization requirement creates new administrative burdens for importers. Long-term contract exemptions provide limited transition time but expire by late 2027. Oil phase-out preparation provisions are also included but with less specific deadlines.
