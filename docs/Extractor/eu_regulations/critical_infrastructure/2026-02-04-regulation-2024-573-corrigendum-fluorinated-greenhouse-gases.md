## L1 — Rule Signal
- **rule_type**: amendment
- **issuing_body**: European Parliament and Council of the European Union
- **document_id**: CELEX:32024R0573R(09)
- **status**: final
- **document_type**: corrigendum
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable
- **effective_date**: 2026-02-04

## L2 — Responsibility Structure
- **affected_roles**: Refrigeration equipment manufacturers, installers, maintenance operators, importers, distributors, Member State enforcement authorities, facility operators
- **shift_type**: restricted
- **shift_summary**: Narrows the applicability threshold for fluorinated gas restrictions by correcting "equal to 12 kW" to "up to 12 kW" for fixed refrigeration units, expanding the scope of equipment subject to restrictions

## L3 — Risk Domains
- Critical infrastructure (refrigeration systems, climate control)
- Environmental compliance (greenhouse gas emissions)
- Supply chain responsibility (equipment manufacturing and maintenance)

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence
- **new_obligations**:
  - Fixed refrigeration units (chillers) with rated capacity up to 12 kW are now subject to fluorinated gas restrictions (previously only those equal to 12 kW)
  - Compliance with Global Warming Potential (GWP) thresholds for refrigerants in broader range of equipment
- **evidence_requirements**:
  - Equipment rated capacity documentation
  - Refrigerant type and GWP specifications
  - Installation and maintenance records
  - Compliance certificates for alternative refrigerants
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes
The corrigendum does not concern the English version - correction applies to other language versions. This technical correction has significant practical impact by expanding the range of refrigeration equipment subject to fluorinated gas restrictions, affecting manufacturers and operators of smaller-capacity systems. The change from "equal to" to "up to" broadens the regulatory scope.
