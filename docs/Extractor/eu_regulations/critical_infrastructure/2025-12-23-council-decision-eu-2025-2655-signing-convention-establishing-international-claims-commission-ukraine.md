## Notes

**Category Selection Rationale:**
Selected "critical_infrastructure" as closest match. This decision establishes an international institutional mechanism for war damage claims processing, involving cross-border coordination and creating critical legal infrastructure for future reparations. While not traditional critical infrastructure (energy, telecommunications, etc.), it establishes essential legal/institutional infrastructure with geopolitical significance. Alternative categories considered: financial_compliance (reparations funding), but critical_infrastructure better captures the institutional framework establishment.

**Key Contextual Elements:**
- Second component of international compensation mechanism (first: Register of Damage for Ukraine)
- Builds on UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/ES-11/5 (2022)
- Preparatory work involves Council of Europe administrative committees
- Approximately 55 participating delegations globally
- Decision requires subsequent Council conclusion under Article 218(6) TFEU for full ratification
