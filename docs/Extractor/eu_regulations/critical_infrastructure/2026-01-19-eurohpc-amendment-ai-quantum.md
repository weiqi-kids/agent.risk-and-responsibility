## Notes
This regulation significantly expands the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking beyond traditional supercomputing to include AI gigafactories (large-scale facilities for developing and deploying advanced AI models) and quantum technologies. The financial contribution increase and new co-financing requirements represent a major EU commitment to digital infrastructure sovereignty and technological competitiveness. Financed through partnership between the Union and participating states across multiple EU programmes (Horizon Europe, Digital Europe Programme, Connecting Europe Facility).
