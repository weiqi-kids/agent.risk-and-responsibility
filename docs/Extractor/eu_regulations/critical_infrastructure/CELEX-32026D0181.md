## What Changed

This decision establishes the EU's negotiating position for amending Annex I to the EU-Switzerland ETS linking agreement, incorporating revisions to Directive 2003/87/EC.

### Stationary Installations Requirements

**Coverage**:
- Mandatory participation for activities covered by Directive 2003/87/EC Annex I (as of 1 January 2025)
- Essential criteria aligned with EU ETS framework

**Linear Reduction Factors**:
- **2024-2027**: 4.3% annually
- **2028 onward**: 4.4% annually

**Market Stability Reserve (MSR)**: Full implementation of EU mechanism for supply-demand balancing

**Free Allocation**:
- Based on benchmarks per Articles 10-10c of Directive 2003/87/EC
- Ensures equivalent treatment for Swiss installations

**Penalties**: "In the same circumstances and magnitude" as specified in Article 16 of Directive 2003/87/EC

### Aviation Sector Requirements

**Coverage**:
- Mandatory for flights arriving at or departing from Swiss aerodromes
- Exclusions: military, police, customs, emergency medical, humanitarian, and training flights

**Emission Cap**: "Reflecting similar stringency" to EU ETS aviation provisions

**2024-2025 Benchmarks**: Modified to 0.000642186914222035 allowances per tonne-kilometre

**Administration**: One-stop shop system with designated EU and Swiss authorities

**Non-CO2 Effects**: Monitoring and reporting requirements apply from 2025

## Who Must Act

**EU Member States' representatives in Joint Committee**:
- Adopt position based on draft decision during ninth meeting or written procedure
- May agree to minor changes without Council re-approval (Article 1(2))

**European Commission**:
- Coordinate market oversight
- Establish bilateral arrangements with Swiss authorities
- Monitor implementation of one-stop shop system

**Swiss Competent Authorities**:
- Administer designated aircraft operators
- Manage auction mechanisms
- Implement monitoring and reporting for non-CO2 aviation effects from 2025

**Stationary installations in Switzerland**:
- Participate in EU-linked ETS
- Comply with linear reduction requirements (4.3% 2024-2027, 4.4% from 2028)
- Surrender allowances equivalent to verified emissions

**Aircraft operators (EU and Swiss)**:
- Implement non-CO2 monitoring and reporting from 2025
- Comply with one-stop shop administration procedures
- Surrender allowances based on modified benchmarks for 2024-2025

**Joint Committee**:
- Adopt Annex I amendments
- Monitor ongoing implementation
- Address future technical adjustments

## Shift in Risk/Responsibility

**Shift Type**: expanded

**What responsibility is transferred/created**:
- Swiss installations face accelerated decarbonization trajectory (4.3% reduction 2024-2027, 4.4% from 2028)
- Aviation operators must implement non-CO2 emissions monitoring from 2025 (new climate impact transparency requirement)
- Swiss competent authorities assume auction management responsibilities equivalent to EU Member States
- Market Stability Reserve integration creates cross-border allowance supply adjustments affecting both EU and Swiss participants
- One-stop shop administration requires bilateral coordination between EU and Swiss authorities for aircraft operator oversight

**Enforcement Signal**: mandatory

**Justification cited**:
Following EU adoption of Directive (EU) 2023/958 (aviation emissions reduction contribution) and Directive (EU) 2023/959 (system refinements and Market Stability Reserve), the EU-Switzerland ETS linking agreement requires amendment to maintain equivalence and prevent carbon leakage.

The decision explicitly references standards "as in force on 1 January 2025," ensuring Swiss system alignment with latest EU ETS requirements including:
- Accelerated linear reduction factors reflecting increased climate ambition
- Non-CO2 aviation effects monitoring addressing full climate impact
- Enhanced Market Stability Reserve mechanisms for supply-demand balance

## Related Framework

**Parent agreement**: Agreement between the European Union and the Swiss Confederation on the linking of their greenhouse gas emissions trading systems

**Related EU instruments**:
- Directive 2003/87/EC establishing EU ETS
- Directive (EU) 2023/958 (aviation emissions reduction)
- Directive (EU) 2023/959 (system refinements and Market Stability Reserve)
- Market Stability Reserve Decision
