# Regulation (EU) 2026/261 on phasing out Russian natural gas imports and preparing the phase-out of Russian oil imports

## Metadata
- **CELEX Number**: 32026R0261
- **Document Type**: regulation
- **Binding Force**: directly_applicable
- **Date of Adoption**: 2026-01-26
- **Date of Entry into Force**: 2026-02-03

- **Publication Reference**: OJ L, 2026/261, 2.2.2026
- **Legal Basis**: Articles 194(2) and 207 TFEU

## Objective
Establish legally binding phase-out of Russian natural gas imports while strengthening monitoring of energy dependencies and preparing parallel phase-out of Russian oil imports to reduce EU strategic vulnerability and support Ukraine.

## Key Provisions

### Gas Import Prohibitions
1. **Pipeline Gas**: Prohibited from 2026-06-17
2. **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)**: Prohibited from 2026-04-25

### Temporary Exemptions
1. **Short-term contracts** concluded before 2025-06-17: Extended until specified deadlines
2. **Long-term pipeline contracts**: May continue until 2027-09-30
3. **Landlocked countries**: Special provisions allowing extensions through 2027-09-30

### Prior Authorization Requirements
- All imports require advance authorization
- Detailed documentation establishing country of production
- Authorities may request complete contract information (excluding pricing) to verify compliance

### Energy Dependency Monitoring Framework
1. Mandatory national diversification plans by Member States
2. Monthly reporting by customs authorities
3. Commission assessments of market risks
4. Enhanced oversight mechanisms

### Oil Phase-Out Preparation
Member States must develop parallel diversification plans for crude oil and petroleum products, addressing existing restrictive measures while preparing for potential future prohibitions.

## Risk & Responsibility Impact

### Shift Type
- new
- expanded

### Responsibility Changes
1. **Member States**: Develop and implement national gas diversification plans; prepare oil diversification strategies; establish prior authorization systems; ensure customs reporting compliance
2. **Energy companies**: Apply for import authorizations; provide country-of-origin documentation; comply with prohibition deadlines; restructure supply chains
3. **European Commission**: Assess market risks; monitor implementation; evaluate exemption requests; coordinate EU-wide response
4. **Customs authorities**: Implement monthly reporting; verify country of origin; enforce import prohibitions

### Enforcement Signal
- mandatory

### Sectors Affected
- Energy supply (gas and oil)
- Critical infrastructure
- Industrial manufacturing (gas-dependent sectors)
- Electricity generation
- District heating
- Chemical industry
- Transport (oil-dependent)

### Jurisdictional Applicability
**Member States Bound**: All EU Member States
**EEA Relevance**: Potentially applicable through EEA Agreement energy provisions
**Third Country Effect**: Affects third-country suppliers and transit operators; extraterritorial implications for contracts involving Russian energy

## Key Obligations

### Member State Obligations
1. Establish prior authorization system for gas imports
2. Develop national gas diversification plans
3. Prepare oil diversification plans
4. Ensure monthly customs reporting
5. Enforce prohibition deadlines
6. Monitor and report on implementation

### Economic Operator Obligations
1. Obtain prior authorization before importing Russian gas (where exemptions apply)
2. Provide complete country-of-origin documentation
3. Terminate or restructure supply arrangements by prohibition deadlines
4. Comply with information requests from competent authorities

### Commission Obligations
1. Monitor energy market developments
2. Assess exemption requests
3. Coordinate EU-wide diversification efforts
4. Report to European Parliament and Council

## Implementation Requirements

### Timeline
- **Entry into Force**: 2026-02-03 (day following Official Journal publication)
- **General Prohibition**: 2026-03-18
- **LNG Prohibition**: 2026-04-25
- **Pipeline Gas Prohibition**: 2026-06-17
- **Long-term Contract Expiry**: 2027-09-30 (maximum)

### Implementation Measures Required
1. Establishment of national prior authorization systems
2. Development and submission of diversification plans
3. Implementation of monthly customs reporting mechanisms
4. Coordination with energy market operators
5. Legal framework for contract restructuring

## Compliance Challenges
1. **Supply chain restructuring**: Major logistical and commercial implications for energy importers
2. **Infrastructure adaptation**: Potential need for new LNG terminals, pipelines, storage facilities
3. **Price volatility risk**: Transition may create short-term market disruptions
4. **Landlocked Member States**: Geographic constraints requiring alternative supply routes
5. **Contract law implications**: Existing long-term supply agreements may face force majeure disputes
