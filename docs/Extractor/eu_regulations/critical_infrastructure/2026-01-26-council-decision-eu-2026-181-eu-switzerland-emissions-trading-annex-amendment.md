- Meet cap requirements with linear reduction factor of 4.3% (2024-2027) and 4.4% (2028+)

**For Aviation Operators**:
- Mandatory participation for flights arriving/departing Swiss aerodromes (with EEA exemptions)
- CO2-only emissions coverage
- Comply with cap based on 2023 baseline with linear reductions
- Apply specific benchmarks for free allowance allocation
- Coordinate with competent authorities in both jurisdictions

**For Competent Authorities**:
- Implement market stability mechanisms aligned between EU and Swiss systems
- Oversee monitoring, reporting, verification, and accreditation requirements

- Administrative sanctions for non-compliance with MRV requirements
- Financial penalties for market manipulation
- Allowance forfeitures for fraudulent reporting

**Risk Level**: High - non-compliance affects installation operations, market access, and may result in significant financial penalties
