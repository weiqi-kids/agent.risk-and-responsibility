## L1 — Rule Signal

- **rule_type**: new
- **document_type**: Council Decision
- **binding_force**: unknown

- **celex_number**: 32025D2563
- **effective_date**: 2025-11-24
- **transposition_deadline**: N/A (Decision directly applicable)

Council Decision (EU) 2025/2563 establishes the European Union's official position at the International Maritime Organization (IMO) 34th Assembly session, supporting amendments to maritime safety codes: the Code on Alerts and Indicators (2025) and Survey Guidelines under the Harmonized System of Survey and Certification (HSSC) (2025). These amendments affect Union law in areas related to passenger ship safety (Directive 2009/45/EC) and ship inspection standards (Regulation (EC) No 391/2009).

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: EU Member States maritime authorities, ship operators under EU jurisdiction, maritime safety inspectors, vessel certification bodies
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: 明確授權成員國代表歐盟在 IMO 會議中表達立場，更新海事安全規範與船舶檢驗指引

## L3 — Risk Domains

**Critical Infrastructure (Maritime Safety)**
- Updated alert and indicator codes may require modifications to vessel bridge systems and crew training protocols
- Revised survey guidelines affect ship certification processes and inspection schedules
- Alignment with IMO standards impacts EU passenger ship safety regime

**Compliance & Enforcement**
- Member States must coordinate position at IMO level despite EU not being IMO member
- Amendments revoke previous IMO Resolutions A.1021(26) and A.1186(33), requiring regulatory alignment
- Potential gap during transition period if national laws not updated concurrently

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Member States authorized to support adoption of IMO amendments at 34th Assembly session; subsequent transposition into national maritime safety frameworks where amendments intersect with Directive 2009/45/EC and Regulation (EC) No 391/2009
- **evidence_requirements**: Documentation of position taken at IMO Assembly; records of alignment actions with revised Code on Alerts and Indicators and HSSC Survey Guidelines; compliance reports from maritime safety authorities
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This Decision represents EU coordination mechanism for international maritime governance. While categorized under critical_infrastructure, it has procedural significance for how EU exercises competence in international maritime organizations. The actual technical amendments to alert codes and survey guidelines will require detailed implementation tracking once IMO formally adopts them. File location reflects original placement but could alternatively fit under supply_chain given maritime transport implications.
