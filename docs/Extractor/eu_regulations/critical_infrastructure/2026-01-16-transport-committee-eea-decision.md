## Notes

This decision coordinates EU positioning within the Energy Community governance framework rather than imposing direct obligations on EU member states. The 25 breach determinations indicate systematic non-compliance issues across all nine contracting parties with Energy Community treaty obligations. Enhanced anti-fraud measures align Energy Community procedures with EU standards (OLAF/EPPO cooperation). Budget implementation timeline is immediate (effective 2026-01-01), suggesting urgency in establishing financial accountability mechanisms.
