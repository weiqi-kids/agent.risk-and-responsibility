This Decision amends Decision (EU) 2023/746 by extending its application period until end of 2028. The document focuses on procedural coordination for EU participation in ICAO standardization processes, particularly in areas where the Union has exclusive competence over civil aviation safety and air navigation. The extension ensures continuity of the EU's unified voice within ICAO on technical standards affecting aviation operations across Member States.
