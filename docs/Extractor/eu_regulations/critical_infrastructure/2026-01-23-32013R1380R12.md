## Notes

This is a technical correction (corrigendum) to Article 11(1) of the 2013 Common Fisheries Policy Regulation. The error corrected an incorrect directive reference from 93/42/EEG (Medical Devices) to 92/43/EEG (Habitats Directive), which is the legally relevant directive for marine conservation measures. While the original regulation addresses fisheries management, the corrected provision specifically concerns environmental conservation obligations, making critical_infrastructure the most appropriate category given its focus on marine ecosystem protection and resource management. This corrigendum does not introduce new obligations but ensures legal clarity for existing conservation measure frameworks.
