## Notes
Corrigendum published on 8 January 2026 (OJ L 2026/90004) correcting three textual elements in Council Decision (EU) 2025/2307 of 13 October 2025. The corrections are purely stylistic, modifying the formatting of the UN Cybercrime Convention title to separate the convention name from its descriptive subtitle using semicolon instead of quotation marks. Changes apply to the decision title, Recital 1, and Article 1. The original decision authorizes EU signature of the UN Convention on strengthening international cooperation against certain IT-related offenses and electronic evidence communication for serious crimes. References Council Decision (EU) 2022/895 which authorized the Commission to negotiate the convention.
