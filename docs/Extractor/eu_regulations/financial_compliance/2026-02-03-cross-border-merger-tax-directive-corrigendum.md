This is a linguistic corrigendum correcting Article 15(1) grammar. The substantive anti-avoidance authority of Member States remains unchanged. The corrigendum does not affect the English version. Original directive applies to mergers, divisions, partial divisions, asset contributions, share exchanges between companies in different Member States, and SE/SCE seat transfers.
