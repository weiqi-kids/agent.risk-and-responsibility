## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Directive
- **binding_force**: requires_transposition

- **rule_type**: amendment
- **jurisdiction**: EU
- **scope_entity**: municipal waste incineration facilities (>20 MW), ETS participants, Member States
- **scope_activity**: emissions trading, municipal waste incineration, carbon credit accounting
- **timeline_enforcement**: 2026-01-09 (corrigendum published)
- **timeline_compliance**: 2026-07 (Commission evaluation), 2028 onwards (potential ETS inclusion)
- **penalty_range**: ETS compliance mechanisms under Articles 14 and 15 of Directive 2003/87/EC
- **reference_regime**: EU Emissions Trading System (Directive 2003/87/EC), Market Stability Reserve (Decision EU 2015/1814)

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: waste management facility operators, national emissions trading authorities, Commission evaluation teams, Member State environmental regulators
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **shift_summary**: Corrigendum standardizes terminology from "urban waste" to "municipal waste" across Directive 2023/959, ensuring consistency with EU waste classification standards. This affects recital 98 and Annex provisions regarding municipal waste incineration facilities above 20 MW thermal capacity. The underlying directive prepares for potential ETS inclusion of these facilities from 2028, requiring Commission feasibility evaluation by July 2026.

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **operational**: municipal waste incinerators must prepare for potential ETS compliance obligations from 2028, requiring emissions monitoring infrastructure and carbon accounting systems
- **strategic**: Member States must evaluate impact on regional waste management competitiveness and consider voluntary exclusion mechanisms through 2030
- **reputational**: facilities handling municipal waste incineration face increased transparency expectations as ETS inclusion would make emissions data publicly reportable
- **financial**: potential carbon cost burden on waste management facilities if ETS inclusion proceeds, affecting municipal waste disposal pricing structures

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Commission must complete feasibility evaluation by July 2026 regarding inclusion of municipal waste incineration facilities in ETS; Member States must assess regional competitiveness impacts; facilities above 20 MW thermal capacity must prepare for potential ETS compliance from 2028
- **evidence_requirements**: emissions monitoring data from municipal waste incineration facilities, regional waste management competitiveness assessments, evaluation of voluntary exclusion mechanisms, carbon accounting readiness documentation
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This corrigendum corrects terminology rather than substantive provisions. The underlying Directive 2023/959 amends the EU ETS to potentially include municipal waste incineration facilities from 2028. The standardization to "municipal waste" aligns with EU waste framework definitions, ensuring regulatory consistency across climate and waste management legislation. Facilities should monitor the July 2026 Commission evaluation for sector inclusion decisions.
