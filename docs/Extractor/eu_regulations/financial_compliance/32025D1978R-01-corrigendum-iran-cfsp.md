## Legal Basis
Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) framework under TEU; amends foundational Decision 2010/413/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Iran.

## Objective
Technical correction of SWIFT/BIC code formatting errors in the CFSP sanctions list targeting Iranian financial institutions, ensuring alignment between CFSP framework and implementing regulation.

## Key Provisions

### Specific Corrections

2. **Entry 173 (Annex)**: SWIFT code spacing corrected from "REF AIRTH" to "REFAIRTH"

### Scope
Technical amendments to financial institution identifiers in the sanctions designations list without altering substantive policy measures or listing criteria.

## Risk & Responsibility Impact

### Shift Type
- clarified

### Responsibility Changes
Clarification ensures accurate identification of sanctioned Iranian financial institutions under CFSP framework, complementing parallel correction in Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1980.

### Enforcement Signal

### Sectors Affected
- Foreign and security policy implementation
- Financial sanctions compliance
- International banking operations
- Diplomatic relations

### Jurisdictional Applicability

**EEA Relevance**: Limited (CFSP decisions generally do not extend to EEA/EFTA states, though national implementation may occur)
**Third Country Effect**: Indirect extraterritorial implications for entities engaged with listed Iranian financial institutions

## Key Obligations
1. Member States must apply corrected SWIFT/BIC codes in CFSP sanctions implementation
2. Competent authorities must update national sanctions lists accordingly
