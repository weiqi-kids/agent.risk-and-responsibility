## L1 — Rule Signal

- **rule_type**: Regulation (Amending)
- **issuing_body**: European Parliament and Council of the European Union
- **document_id**: CELEX:32025R2649
- **status**: In Force
- **document_type**: Legislative Act (Ordinary Legislative Procedure)
- **binding_force**: Directly applicable in all EU Member States
- **effective_date**: 2025-12-31
- **transposition_deadline**: N/A (directly applicable)

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**:
  - EU Member States (CAP Strategic Plan implementers, paying agencies, control authorities)
  - Small-scale farmers (exemption beneficiaries under simplified conditionality schemes)
  - Young farmers (extended eligibility periods for compliance investments)
  - Organic farmers (presumption of GAEC compliance with valid certification)
  - Agricultural payment recipients (all CAP direct payment beneficiaries)
  - Producer organisations (fruit and vegetable sector intervention programs)

- **shift_type**: clarified

- **shift_summary**: This amending regulation reduces administrative burden on small and organic farmers by introducing conditionality exemptions, presumes GAEC standard compliance for certified organic producers, and simplifies CAP Strategic Plan amendment procedures. Member States gain flexibility in crisis payment interventions while maintaining environmental standards through reformed control systems.

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **Compliance Risk**: Farmers must maintain valid organic certification (Regulation 2018/848) to claim GAEC exemptions; loss of certification triggers retroactive non-compliance
- **Administrative Risk**: Member States must correctly distinguish "strategic amendments" (requiring Commission approval) from "non-strategic amendments" (notification-only), with potential payment suspension for incorrect classification
- **Financial Risk**: Crisis payment interventions must comply with WTO agricultural agreement criteria; non-compliant payments risk trade disputes and subsidy recovery
- **Audit Risk**: Merged control systems (LPIS/GSA/AMS quality assessments) create new audit requirements for national competent authorities
- **Operational Risk**: Extended young farmer compliance periods (36 months) require tracking systems to monitor investment completion and standard achievement

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

**new_obligations**:

- Member States must update CAP Strategic Plans to incorporate simplified amendment procedures, establishing criteria to distinguish strategic from non-strategic changes (Articles 107, 109, 110, 113, 119 of Regulation 2021/2115 as amended)
- Paying agencies must implement conditionality exemptions for small farmers under simplified payment schemes (Article 28 Regulation 2021/2115 as amended)
- Control authorities must presume GAEC 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 compliance for certified organic farmers, requiring verification of valid organic certification under Regulation 2018/848
- Member States may design crisis payment interventions for natural disasters and adverse climatic events, ensuring compliance with WTO agricultural agreement parameters
- National authorities must maintain updated LPIS/GSA/AMS merged quality assessment systems with documentation proving satellite monitoring accuracy where used instead of on-site inspections

**evidence_requirements**:

- Organic certification records (valid certificates issued per Regulation 2018/848) proving farmer eligibility for GAEC compliance presumptions
- Holding size documentation and classification records demonstrating small farmer status for conditionality exemption eligibility
- CAP Strategic Plan amendment submissions with Commission approval confirmations (for strategic amendments) or notification date records (for non-strategic amendments)
- Investment completion documentation for young farmers claiming extended 36-month compliance periods, including evidence of new standard achievement
- Crisis payment intervention documentation proving eligibility criteria, WTO compliance, and affected farmer identification
- Satellite monitoring validation data demonstrating accuracy thresholds where used to replace on-site control inspections
- Modified annual performance reports excluding annual performance clearance data (as per amended Article 54 of Regulation 2021/2116)

- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

- Payment suspensions may be imposed for incorrect CAP Strategic Plan amendment classifications or failure to implement Commission-approved strategic changes
- Retroactive penalties apply to farmers who claimed GAEC exemptions with subsequently invalidated or fraudulent organic certifications
- Commission retains authority to adopt implementing and delegated acts to operationalize amendments and enforce compliance with conditionality systems
- Annual performance reporting maintains oversight mechanisms despite removal of annual performance clearance requirements
- National control systems subject to Commission audit for merged LPIS/GSA/AMS quality assessment accuracy

## Notes

This regulation represents the EU's administrative simplification agenda within the Common Agricultural Policy framework, reducing compliance burden on small and organic farmers while maintaining environmental protection standards. The shift from annual performance clearance to streamlined reporting reduces bureaucratic overhead for Member States.

The presumption of GAEC compliance for certified organic farmers (GAEC 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) recognizes that organic farming systems inherently meet many environmental standards, but creates certification dependency risk—farmers must maintain continuous valid certification to avoid retroactive non-compliance.

The bifurcated amendment procedure (strategic vs. non-strategic) introduces classification risk: Member States must correctly determine which CAP Strategic Plan changes require Commission approval versus notification-only, with potential payment disruptions for misclassification.

Crisis payment interventions provide Member States flexibility to respond to natural disasters and adverse climatic events, but require careful WTO agricultural agreement compliance to avoid international trade disputes and subsidy recovery proceedings.

The regulation applies to agricultural financial year 2025 and subsequent years, with no retroactive effect on earlier years, providing clear temporal scope for compliance obligations.
