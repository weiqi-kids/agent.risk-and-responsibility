## L1 — Rule Signal

- **rule_type**: revision
- **issuing_body**: European Parliament and Council
- **document_id**: CELEX:32025R2653
- **status**: in_force
- **document_type**: Regulation
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable
- **effective_date**: 2025-12-23
- **transposition_deadline**: N/A

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: EU funding programme administrators, Member State defence procurement authorities, defence industry SMEs and mid-caps, dual-use technology developers, transport and digital infrastructure providers, research institutions receiving EU funding
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **shift_summary**: Regulation amends five major EU funding programmes (Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, Connecting Europe Facility, European Defence Fund, STEP) to integrate defence-related investment criteria and simplified procedures. Creates obligation for programme administrators to prioritise defence technologies and military mobility infrastructure, with enhanced co-financing rates and pre-financing requirements.

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **Compliance gaps**: Entities in defence supply chains must verify third-country control status to ensure eligibility; failure to demonstrate defence-technology relevance may disqualify projects from enhanced funding rates
- **Resource allocation**: Funding bodies face pressure to balance civilian and defence priorities within existing programme budgets; SMEs lacking defence certification may lose competitive advantage
- **Operational continuity**: Infrastructure projects not aligned with EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors risk losing access to 10 percentage point co-financing increases
- **Geopolitical exposure**: Legal entities controlled by non-associated third countries face participation restrictions, requiring ownership structure audits and potential restructuring

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Commission must update STEP guidance to include defence technologies as fourth strategic sector by 2026-02-24; programme administrators must incorporate defence-related criteria into call texts; Member States must enable dual-use infrastructure projects along military mobility corridors; funding bodies must provide 20% minimum pre-financing for designated defence infrastructure projects; resource commitments from cohesion programme transfers must be completed by 2027-09-30
- **evidence_requirements**: Applicants must demonstrate defence-technology relevance and dual-use potential; entities must disclose third-country control status; infrastructure projects must align with designated EU Priority Military Mobility Corridors; co-financing rate justifications must reference defence strategic objectives
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This regulation operationalises the ReArm Europe Plan by embedding defence investment incentives across five major EU funding programmes. Unlike previous defence-specific instruments, this measure integrates defence criteria into civilian programmes (Horizon Europe, Digital Europe, Connecting Europe Facility), creating cross-sectoral compliance obligations. The 10 percentage point co-financing increase for military mobility infrastructure and 20% pre-financing requirement represent significant financial compliance shifts for infrastructure providers. Third-country control restrictions introduce supply chain audit requirements similar to those in EU Chips Act and Critical Raw Materials Act. The 2027-09-30 deadline for cohesion programme transfers indicates accelerated defence spending timeframes compared to standard EU budget cycles.
