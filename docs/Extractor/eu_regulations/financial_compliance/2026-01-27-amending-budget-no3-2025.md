## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: EU Member State Finance Ministries, European Commission Budget Directorate, European Parliament Budget Committee, Council of the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council, EU Court of Auditors, All EU Institutional Budget Officers
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: Member states must provide adjusted own resources totaling EUR 154.322 billion through customs duties (EUR 22.179 billion), VAT-based contributions (EUR 23.815 billion), plastic packaging waste levy (EUR 6.848 billion), and GNI-based resources (EUR 101.480 billion at 0.5472% GNI call rate). EU institutions implement staffing and expenditure modifications across administrative and operational budgets.

## L3 — Risk Domains

**Financial Compliance Risk**: Member states face adjusted contribution obligations with EUR 1.253 billion increase in total own resources. Failure to remit customs duties, VAT-based resources, or plastic waste levies on revised schedules creates payment default risk and potential infringement proceedings.

**Budget Execution Risk**: EU institutions must reallocate resources within fiscal year 2025 constraints. Parliament faces EUR 5.2 million reduction requiring immediate staffing and operational adjustments. Commission expenditure shifts across digital, climate, and migration programs require rapid reallocation of committed funds.

**Revenue Volatility Risk**: Financial revenue increases EUR 1.185 billion driven by competition enforcement fines (EUR 654.3 million) and member state penalty payments (EUR 528 million). Over-reliance on non-predictable enforcement revenue creates budget planning uncertainty for subsequent fiscal years.

**Administrative Capacity Risk**: Staffing reductions and salary modifications across all EU institutions during mid-fiscal-year create operational continuity challenges. Court of Justice, Court of Auditors, and Ombudsman face resource constraints while maintaining statutory obligations.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Member states must remit adjusted own resources reflecting EUR 1.3 billion customs duty increase and EUR 46.9 million GNI-based resource decrease. All 27 member states provide contributions based on recalculated customs revenues, VAT bases (capped at 50% GNI), and plastic packaging waste data. EU institutions implement assigned revenue tracking totaling EUR 4.825 billion across all bodies. Commission enforces budget discipline per Interinstitutional Agreement provisions.
- **evidence_requirements**: Member states submit updated customs duty collection reports, VAT base calculations with 50% GNI cap verification, plastic packaging waste levy documentation supporting EUR 6.848 billion total. EU institutions maintain assigned revenue accounts demonstrating EUR 4.825 billion allocation compliance. Commission provides quarterly budget execution reports tracking EUR 161.163 billion total budget implementation. Court of Auditors verifies all institutional expenditure modifications and member state contribution remittances.
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This amending budget document represents the third modification to EU's 2025 fiscal framework and has now expired as of 31 December 2025. The regulation demonstrates EU's mid-year budget adjustment mechanisms responding to revenue fluctuations, particularly increased enforcement revenues from competition fines and member state penalties.

Key financial shifts include surplus carryover increasing 112.53% while miscellaneous revenue decreased 30.79%. The GNI call rate of 0.5472% applied to all member states represents the core funding mechanism supplemented by traditional own resources (customs/levies) and newer revenue streams (plastic waste levy introduced under 2020/2053 own resources decision).

Institutional budget reductions to Parliament (EUR 5.2 million) and Council (EUR 1.68 million) reflect ongoing efficiency adjustments while Commission expenditure reallocations support digital transformation, climate action, and migration management priorities. The assigned revenue framework (EUR 4.825 billion) enables institutions to retain specific revenues for designated purposes beyond general budget allocations.

Procedural timeline shows rapid adoption (Commission proposal 2025-10-03 to proclamation 2025-11-26) demonstrating streamlined budget amendment processes. Legal basis citing TFEU Article 314 and Regulation 2024/2509 confirms alignment with post-2020 multiannual financial framework governance structures.
