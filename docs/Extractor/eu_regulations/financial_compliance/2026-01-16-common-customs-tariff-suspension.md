## Notes

This revision modifies Council Regulation (EU) 2021/2278 by updating the annex listing products subject to tariff suspensions. Key changes include suspensions on battery production materials, chemical compounds, rare-earth metals, and agricultural oils. Each suspension includes a specific review date (between 31.12.2026 and 31.12.2030), indicating temporary nature of tariff benefits. Economic operators should monitor review schedules to anticipate potential duty restoration. The regulation forms part of EU trade policy instruments enabling cost-competitive imports for industrial use.
