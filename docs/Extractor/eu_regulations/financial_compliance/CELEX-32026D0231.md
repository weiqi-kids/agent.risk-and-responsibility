## What Changed

This decision establishes the EU's negotiating position within the EEA Joint Committee to incorporate the central counterparty (CCP) recovery and resolution framework into the EEA Agreement through amendments to three annexes.

### Annex IX Amendments (Financial Services)

**Primary incorporation**: Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on framework for recovery and resolution of central counterparties, including:
- Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/450 (resolution planning technical standards)
- Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/451 (critical functions assessment standards)
- Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/840 (supervisory cooperation requirements)

**Key obligations**:
- EFTA Surveillance Authority involvement in suspension decisions for OTC derivative clearing obligations
- National competent authorities and resolution authorities in EFTA States must implement CCP recovery/resolution procedures
- Resolution colleges must include EFTA State authorities when relevant
- Adaptation: Article 76 of Regulation (EU) 2021/23 explicitly does not apply to EFTA States

### Annex XII Amendments (Free Movement of Capital)

Links financial collateral arrangements directive (2002/47/EC) to CCP framework for cross-border capital movements related to resolution proceedings.

### Annex XXII Amendments (Company Law)

Incorporates company law directives with CCP recovery/resolution provisions to ensure corporate governance alignment during resolution procedures.

## Who Must Act

**EEA Joint Committee**: Adopt the decision amending the three annexes.

**EFTA Surveillance Authority**:
- Participate in decisions to suspend clearing obligations
- Monitor EFTA States' implementation of CCP resolution framework
- Coordinate with EU authorities on supervisory matters

**EFTA States competent authorities**:
- Designate national resolution authorities for CCPs
- Implement recovery and resolution planning requirements
- Participate in resolution colleges
- Enforce resolution tools and powers per Regulation (EU) 2021/23

**Central counterparties in EFTA States**:
- Prepare recovery plans
- Maintain resolvability assessments
- Comply with resolution planning requirements
- Implement critical functions identification procedures

**Financial market participants**:
- Adjust to potential suspension of OTC derivative clearing obligations
- Prepare for CCP resolution scenarios affecting collateral arrangements

## Shift in Risk/Responsibility

**Shift Type**: new

**What responsibility is transferred/created**:
- EFTA States must establish CCP resolution regimes equivalent to EU framework
- Resolution authorities in EFTA States gain powers to intervene in failing CCPs (write-down, conversion, transfer of positions/contracts)
- CCP shareholders and creditors in EFTA States become subject to bail-in mechanisms
- Clearing members face new resolution scenarios affecting their positions and collateral
- EFTA Surveillance Authority assumes coordination role in cross-border CCP resolution

**Enforcement Signal**: mandatory

**Justification cited**:
"Following the Union's adoption of Regulation (EU) 2021/23 on a framework for the recovery and resolution of central counterparties, the EEA Agreement should be updated accordingly to ensure the functioning of the internal market and a level playing field between operators in the Union and the EFTA States."

The decision ensures financial stability by extending CCP resolution tools to EFTA States, preventing regulatory arbitrage and ensuring consistent crisis management across the EEA.
