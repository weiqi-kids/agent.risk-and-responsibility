3. Electronics
4. Computers
5. Telecommunications and information security
6. Sensors and lasers
7. Navigation and avionics
8. Marine
9. Aerospace and propulsion
10. Related technology and software

3. **EU level**: Coordinate enforcement through COARM and customs cooperation networks

## Compliance Challenges
1. **Dual-use item identification**: Many prohibited components have legitimate civilian applications, complicating screening
2. **Supply chain complexity**: Controlled items may be embedded in larger systems or transshipped through third countries
3. **Technology evolution**: Rapid advancement in UAV/missile technology requires frequent updates to controlled items list
4. **Extraterritorial enforcement**: Difficulty in preventing third-country intermediaries from facilitating prohibited exports
5. **Sanctions circumvention**: Risk of shell companies, falsified documentation, and re-routing schemes
6. **Industry awareness**: Small and medium enterprises may lack resources for sophisticated export compliance programs
