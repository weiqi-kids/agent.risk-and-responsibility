## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Regulation
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable

- **rule_type**: amendment
- **rule_scope**: eu_wide
- **binding_level**: binding
- **sector**: banking
- **enforcement_regime**: supervisory_corrective

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Financial institutions using alternative internal model approaches for market risk; competent authorities overseeing capital requirements compliance
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: Corrects critical wording in Article 325t(1) regarding which institutions may be required by competent authorities to use valuation functions within internal risk measurement systems. Changes "which were not granted permission" to "which were granted permission" - reversing the applicability scope for alternative internal model approaches in market risk capital calculations.

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **operational_risk**: Medium - institutions using alternative internal models must verify their systems align with corrected regulatory text to avoid supervisory findings.
- **compliance_risk**: High - the word-level correction reverses the scope of applicability, creating potential for past misinterpretation of obligations.
- **reputational_risk**: Low - technical correction to existing framework with limited public visibility.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Institutions granted permission to use alternative internal model approaches must comply with competent authority requirements to utilize valuation functions integrated within their internal model risk measurement systems for market risk capital requirement calculations and reporting. The correction clarifies this applies to institutions with permission (not those without).
- **evidence_requirements**: Documentation of valuation functions used in internal model risk measurement systems; compliance with competent authority directives on market risk capital calculation methodologies; reporting aligned with corrected Article 325t(1) provisions.
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This corrigendum addresses a critical typographical error that reversed the intended scope of Article 325t(1). The correction ensures that institutions granted permission (rather than denied permission) for alternative internal model approaches are subject to competent authority requirements regarding valuation function integration. Financial institutions should audit their current practices to confirm alignment with the corrected text, particularly if they operate under alternative internal model permissions for market risk assessment.
