## Notes
Technical correction to Council Decision (CFSP) 2025/1978 amending Decision 2010/413/CFSP on Iran restrictive measures. Removes spaces from two SWIFT codes to ensure proper formatting. This corrigendum corrects the same entries as the parallel corrigendum 32025R1980R(01), but under the CFSP (Common Foreign and Security Policy) legal framework rather than the economic sanctions regulation framework.
