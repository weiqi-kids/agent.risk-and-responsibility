## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Directive
- **binding_force**: requires_transposition

- **rule_type**: amendment
- **legal_instrument**: directive_corrigendum
- **celex_number**: 32014L0025R(09)
- **official_title**: Corrigendum to Directive 2014/25/EU on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors
- **date_of_effect**: 2026-01-24
- **parent_directive**: Directive 2014/25/EU
- **scope**: EU Member States, contracting entities in water, energy, transport, postal services sectors
- **enforcement_level**: binding

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Procurement officers and contracting authorities in water supply, energy, transport, postal services sectors; legal counsel for public and quasi-public entities; compliance officers monitoring procurement procedures
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: This corrigendum corrects Article 50 of Directive 2014/25/EU by adding the term "negotiated" before "procedure without prior call for competition", clarifying the specific procurement methodology available to contracting entities in regulated sectors. The change provides terminological precision but does not alter substantive obligations.

## L3 — Risk Domains

Procurement entities in critical infrastructure sectors face clarification risk if they interpreted the original Article 50 wording as allowing broader procedural flexibility. The corrigendum confirms that only negotiated procedures (not general procedures) may be conducted without prior calls for competition in specified circumstances. Organizations that applied non-negotiated procedures under the previous wording may need to review past procurement decisions for procedural compliance.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Contracting entities must use specifically "negotiated procedures" when conducting procurement without prior competition under Article 50 circumstances; procedural documentation must reflect the negotiated nature of the process
- **evidence_requirements**: Procurement records demonstrating use of negotiated procedure methodology; documentation showing circumstances warranting exception from prior call for competition; audit trails confirming adherence to negotiated procedure safeguards
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This is the ninth corrigendum to Directive 2014/25/EU (Utilities Directive), published in Official Journal L 28/30 on 21 January 2026. The correction is narrow and technical, affecting only Article 50's introductory phrase. Organizations should update internal procurement guidance to reflect the explicit requirement for "negotiated" procedures. No new compliance deadlines are established as this clarifies existing requirements. The parent directive (2014/25/EU) repealed the earlier Directive 2004/17/EC and forms part of the 2014 public procurement package alongside Directives 2014/23/EU and 2014/24/EU.
