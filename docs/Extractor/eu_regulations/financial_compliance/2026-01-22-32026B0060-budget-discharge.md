## L3 — Risk Domains

Parliament's refusal to grant discharge creates reputational and procedural risks for EU institutions. Organizations subject to EU budget oversight should note the heightened scrutiny on financial management practices, internal controls, and compliance with Financial Regulation requirements. The decision references Court of Auditors' findings, indicating that audit non-compliance is a material factor in discharge decisions.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: EU Council institutions must resume cooperation with Parliament on discharge procedures; respond to Parliament's questionnaires; participate in discharge hearings; address deficiencies identified in Court of Auditors' reports; implement corrective actions per Regulation 2018/1046 Articles 59, 118, 260-262 and Regulation 2024/2509 Articles 59, 118, 266-268
- **evidence_requirements**: Responses to Parliament's discharge questionnaires; participation records in discharge hearings; documented corrective action plans addressing Court of Auditors' recommendations; audited financial statements demonstrating improved internal controls and compliance with Financial Regulation requirements
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This Decision does not impose new regulatory obligations on private sector entities. It is an internal EU institutional accountability measure. However, it signals Parliament's willingness to use discharge refusal as a governance tool, potentially setting precedent for stricter financial oversight across EU bodies. Organizations contracting with or receiving funding from EU institutions should be aware of heightened audit expectations.
