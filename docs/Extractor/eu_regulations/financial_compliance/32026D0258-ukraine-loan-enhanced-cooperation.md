### Loan Structure
1. **Amount**: EUR 90 billion for 2026-2027
2. **Financing mechanism**: EU capital market borrowing backed by budget headroom
3. **Financial framework**: Expenditures and contingent liabilities exceed multiannual financial framework (MFF) ceilings
4. **Non-participant protection**: Automatic adjustments prevent non-participating states from contributing to financing or guarantee coverage

### Scope and Objectives

### Responsibility Changes

1. **Participating Member States (23)**:
   - Provide budgetary guarantees proportional to participation
   - Accept contingent liabilities exceeding normal MFF constraints
   - Implement domestic approval procedures for loan guarantee framework
   - Monitor loan disbursement and conditionality compliance

2. **Non-participating Member States (4)**:

   - Report to participating Member States and European Parliament

4. **Ukraine (beneficiary)**:

   - Provide regular reporting on use of funds
   - Progress toward EU accession requirements

### Enforcement Signal
- mandatory

### Sectors Affected
- Public finance
- Defense and security
- Economic development
- EU institutional relations
- Capital markets

### Jurisdictional Applicability
**Member States Bound**: 23 participating Member States only
**EEA Relevance**: No (EFTA/EEA states not part of enhanced cooperation)
**Third Country Effect**: Direct effect on Ukraine as loan beneficiary; indirect implications for EU-Ukraine relations and security architecture

## Key Obligations

### Participating Member State Obligations
1. Provide national budgetary guarantees according to participation share
2. Ensure domestic parliamentary/constitutional approval where required
3. Implement loan guarantee framework in national budget procedures
4. Accept contingent liability exceeding standard MFF constraints
5. Monitor and report on loan implementation

### Commission Obligations
1. Execute borrowing operations on capital markets
2. Disburse loan tranches subject to conditionality assessment
3. Monitor Ukraine's compliance with reform commitments
4. Report to participating Member States on loan implementation
5. Manage financial risk and guarantee activation procedures

### Ukraine Obligations (conditionality framework)
1. Implement institutional reforms aligned with EU accession requirements
2. Meet disbursement conditionality criteria
3. Provide transparency on use of funds
4. Maintain fiscal sustainability and debt management framework

## Implementation Requirements

### Timeline
- **Entry into Force**: Day of publication (2026-02-02)
- **Loan Period**: 2026-2027
- **Implementation**: Member States must complete domestic approval procedures for guarantee commitments

### Implementation Measures Required
1. **National level**: Parliamentary approval of guarantee commitments; budget allocation for contingent liabilities
2. **EU level**: Adoption of implementing regulation establishing loan facility terms; negotiation of memorandum of understanding with Ukraine
3. **Ukraine**: Establishment of monitoring and reporting mechanisms for conditionality compliance

## Compliance Challenges
1. **Political risk**: Domestic opposition in participating Member States to large-scale guarantee commitments
2. **Financial risk**: EUR 90 billion contingent liability creates fiscal exposure if Ukraine defaults
3. **Conditionality enforcement**: Difficulty in suspending disbursements if reform implementation lags
4. **Geopolitical uncertainty**: Ongoing conflict affects Ukraine's ability to meet economic and institutional conditions
5. **Enhanced cooperation precedent**: First use of mechanism for financial assistance may face legal challenges
