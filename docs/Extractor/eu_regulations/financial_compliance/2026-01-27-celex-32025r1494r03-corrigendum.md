- **celex_id**: 32025R1494R(03)
- **adoption_date**: 2026-01-27
- **entry_into_force**: 2026-01-27

- **policy_area**: Foreign policy restrictive measures, investor-state dispute settlement, arbitration decisions recognition
- **trigger_event**: Three technical corrections to clarify scope of court, arbitration, and administrative decisions related to sanctions enforcement

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Member State competent authorities (sanctions enforcement), financial institutions subject to EU restrictive measures, legal practitioners handling investor-state dispute settlement cases, arbitration tribunals with EU jurisdiction
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: Corrections broaden the definition of judicial decisions subject to restrictive measures from "court judgments" to include "arbitration decisions and administrative decisions," ensuring comprehensive coverage of all formal dispute resolution mechanisms when enforcing sanctions against Russian Federation entities

## L3 — Risk Domains

**Legal Compliance**: Member States and financial institutions must now explicitly account for arbitration and administrative decisions (not just court judgments) when applying restrictions on recognition and enforcement of decisions involving sanctioned Russian entities.

**Cross-Border Enforcement**: Expanded scope of non-recognizable decisions creates broader legal uncertainty for international arbitration proceedings and investor-state dispute settlements involving Russian parties.

**Financial Risk**: Institutions involved in dispute resolution financing or enforcement must reassess which categories of decisions fall under the restrictive measures regime.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Member States must refuse recognition and enforcement of not only foreign court judgments but also arbitration awards and administrative decisions when these involve Russian entities subject to sanctions. Recovery provisions for damages arising from investor-state dispute settlement now explicitly include arbitration decisions alongside court decisions.
- **evidence_requirements**: Documentation must demonstrate the nature of the decision (court judgment, arbitration award, or administrative decision) and verify whether the parties fall within the scope of EU restrictive measures against the Russian Federation.
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This is a technical corrigendum published in Maltese with cross-references to other EU language versions. The three corrections systematically expand terminology from "court judgment" to "court, arbitration, or administrative decision" across Recital 22 and Articles 11 and 11e. The amendments close potential enforcement gaps by ensuring sanctions apply regardless of dispute resolution forum (judicial, arbitral, or administrative). Timing suggests coordination with ongoing enforcement reviews of Russia-related sanctions packages.
