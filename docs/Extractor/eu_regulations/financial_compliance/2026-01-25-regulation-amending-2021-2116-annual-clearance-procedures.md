## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Regulation
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable

- **Regulation Type:** Revision (amends Regulation (EU) 2021/1755)
- **Scope:** EU Member States receiving Brexit Adjustment Reserve funds
- **Effective Date:** 2026-02-12
- **Enforcement Level:** Directly applicable across all Member States
- **Change Type:** Resource reallocation — reduces maximum Brexit Adjustment Reserve by EUR 584.26 million
- **Trigger:** Geopolitical emergency response (Russia-Ukraine war, energy crisis, inflation spike)
- **Legal Basis:** TFEU Article 175 (economic, social, and territorial cohesion)
- **Novelty:** Redirects pre-allocated Brexit compensation funds to address acute crisis needs

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: EU Member States' budget authorities, European Commission DG REGIO, National authorities managing Recovery and Resilience Facility transfers, Finance ministries planning Brexit-related expenditures
- **shift_type**: restricted
- **shift_summary**: Member States lose access to EUR 584.26 million originally allocated for Brexit economic adjustment, with funds redirected to geopolitical crisis response while protecting already-disbursed pre-financing and RRF transfers.

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **Economic Impact:** Member States with significant Brexit-related economic disruption face reduced support, potentially delaying recovery programs or infrastructure projects dependent on these funds.

- **Budget Planning Risk:** National budgets that anticipated 2025 Brexit Adjustment Reserve payments must be revised. Projects co-financed with these funds may face delays or require alternative national funding.

- **Geopolitical Priority Shift:** Establishes precedent for reallocating crisis-response reserves toward acute emergencies, potentially affecting future special-purpose fund stability.

- **Compliance Continuity:** Protected categories (pre-financing already paid, RRF transfers) ensure existing commitments remain honored, but new applications or adjustments face reduced availability.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: Member States must accept EUR 584.26 million reduction in Brexit Adjustment Reserve ceiling (no opt-out mechanism); Commission must ensure protected categories (pre-financing, RRF transfers) remain untouched; National authorities must update budget forecasts to reflect revised reserve amounts by 2026-02-12 entry into force
- **evidence_requirements**: Member States must maintain documentation proving pre-financing amounts were disbursed before regulation adoption; Transfers to Recovery and Resilience Facility must show formal transfer before 2023-03-01 deadline; Commission reporting must demonstrate EUR 584.26 million redirection to geopolitical crisis response measures
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This regulation demonstrates the EU's willingness to repurpose pre-allocated funds in response to acute geopolitical crises. The EUR 584.26 million reduction represents a significant shift from post-Brexit economic recovery to immediate war-related financial pressures. Member States with large Brexit-exposed sectors (e.g., Ireland, Netherlands, Belgium) may need to increase national co-financing for projects originally planned with these funds. The protection of already-disbursed pre-financing and RRF transfers prevents disruption to ongoing projects, but constrains future flexibility. Organizations advising Member States on Brexit adjustment programs should update funding assumptions and explore alternative EU instruments (e.g., REACT-EU, cohesion policy reallocations) to compensate for the shortfall.
