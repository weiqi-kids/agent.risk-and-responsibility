## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Directive
- **binding_force**: requires_transposition

- **Legal Instrument**: Corrigendum to Council Directive 2006/112/EC
- **Document Type**: Official correction (amendment to existing directive text)
- **Regulatory Authority**: Council of the European Union
- **Original Base**: Council Directive 2006/112/EC (28 November 2006) on common VAT system
- **Affected Provision**: Article 176 (VAT deduction restrictions)
- **Amendment Type**: Terminology corrections
- **Effective Date**: 2026-01-25 (publication date, retroactive correction)
- **Jurisdiction**: EU Member States with retained VAT deduction limitations

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Member States with national VAT legislation predating 1 January 1979 or accession date; Tax authorities implementing VAT deduction rules; Businesses claiming VAT deductions on expenses
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: Terminology corrections clarify that VAT deduction restrictions apply to "representation" (not "entertainment") costs and to "exclusions" (not "exemptions") under retained national provisions. This affects interpretation of which business expenses qualify for VAT deduction.

## L3 — Risk Domains

**Financial Compliance**

Member States retaining VAT deduction limitations must correctly interpret which costs qualify for deduction. The corrigendum clarifies that:

1. **Representation costs** (corrected from "entertainment") are explicitly non-deductible
2. **Luxury items** and non-business expenses remain excluded from VAT deduction
3. **Retained national provisions** are "exclusions" (not "exemptions"), affecting legal interpretation

**Compliance Risk**: Businesses may need to review expense classification policies to align with corrected terminology, particularly for representation/entertainment costs.

**Enforcement Risk**: Member States must ensure national VAT legislation reflects corrected terminology, with unanimous Council decision required to define non-qualifying costs.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: No new substantive obligations. Terminology corrections clarify existing Article 176 requirements: (1) VAT deduction prohibited for costs that are not strictly business expenses, including luxury items and representation; (2) Council must unanimously decide which costs do not qualify for deduction; (3) Member States may retain pre-1979 (or pre-accession) national provisions excluding certain costs from VAT deduction.
- **evidence_requirements**: Not specified in corrigendum. Existing evidence requirements for VAT deduction claims under Directive 2006/112/EC remain applicable.
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This corrigendum makes two technical corrections to Article 176 of the 2006 VAT Directive:

1. **"Entertainment" → "Representation"**: Changes term in list of non-deductible costs. Both terms refer to hospitality/client entertainment expenses, but "representation" is more precise legal terminology in EU context.

2. **"Exemptions" → "Exclusions"**: Changes term describing retained national provisions. "Exclusions" is technically accurate because these provisions prevent VAT deduction eligibility, rather than exempting transactions from VAT.

**Practical Impact**: Limited. These are clarificatory amendments to 2006 directive text, not substantive policy changes. However, businesses and tax authorities should use corrected terminology when interpreting VAT deduction restrictions.

**Cross-Reference**: Directive 2006/112/EC Article 176 establishes VAT deduction limitations for non-business expenses. Member States that had such limitations on 1 January 1979 (or accession date) may retain them until Council unanimously decides otherwise.
