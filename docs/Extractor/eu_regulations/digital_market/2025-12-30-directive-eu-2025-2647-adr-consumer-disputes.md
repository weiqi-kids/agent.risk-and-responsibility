## Notes
Application date is 20 September 2028. The directive extends ADR coverage to disputes involving third-country traders directing activities toward EU Member States and disputes regarding digital content/services where consumers provide personal data instead of paying a price. Disputes now cover "contractual obligations, including obligations stemming from the pre-contractual phase," protecting consumers from misleading advertising and manipulative practices.
