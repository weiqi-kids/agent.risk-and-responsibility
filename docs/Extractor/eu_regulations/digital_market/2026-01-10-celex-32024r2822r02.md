## L1 — Rule Signal
- **rule_type**: amendment
- **issuing_body**: European Parliament and Council
- **document_id**: CELEX:32024R2822R(02)
- **status**: final
- **document_type**: regulation
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable
- **effective_date**: 2025-12-17
- **transposition_deadline**: N/A

## L2 — Responsibility Structure
- **affected_roles**: EUIPO (European Union Intellectual Property Office) for executing Community Design registration, publication and invalidity procedures; design applicants and holders for submitting compliant design representations and exercising infringement prohibition rights; EU Member State courts for handling unregistered design infringement litigation
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: 本勘誤修正 Regulation (EU) 2024/2822 中 14 處語言與技術錯誤，涉及共同體外觀設計的註冊程序、權利持有人保護範圍、著作權累積保護、無效程序命名等。核心變動包括：釐清未註冊外觀設計持有人的禁止侵權行為權利（第 19(4) 條）、明確電子通訊時代 EUIPO 決定的識別方法（第 62(2) 條）、將無效程序條款標題從「有效性」改為「無效性」（第 86 條）。勘誤未改變實質法律義務，但提升了法規文本的精確性與跨語言一致性。

## L3 — Risk Domains
- Intellectual property rights (design protection)
- Digital market (EUIPO electronic procedures)
- Electronic application and communication systems (Article 62(2): decision identification methods in electronic communication era)
- Digitalized design representation and publication systems (Article 36(5): design representation requirements)
- Procedural risk: applicants may face document submission gaps if misunderstanding language changes after corrigendum (e.g., Article 48(3) "filing date of the application")
- Rights exercise risk: unregistered design holders need to correctly understand scope of "infringement prohibition" rights under revised Article 19(4) wording
- Cross-language risk: corrigendum covers Dutch, German and other language versions, requiring enterprises to verify consistency across language versions
- Copyright cumulative protection scope ambiguity: Article 36 changed from "ensure" to "allow" coexistence of design rights and copyright, but priority order in conflicts remains unclear
- Procedural restoration discretion: Article 67ter(2) changed from "shall" to "may" restore procedures, increasing EUIPO discretion without providing discretion standards

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence
- **new_obligations**: (1) EUIPO electronic communication identification (Article 62(2)): decisions issued by EUIPO via electronic communication must be presented in an "identifiable manner"; evidence forms include electronic signatures, system logs, official notification copies. (2) Design representation requirements (Article 36(5)): applicants must submit design representations complying with EUIPO regulations (corrigendum removes redundant wording "and means thereof"); evidence forms include compliant image files, 3D model files. (3) Unregistered design rights scope (Article 19(4)): holders have the right to prohibit third-party infringement acts without consent; evidence forms include proof of first public disclosure date, infringement evidence (product photos, sales records). Audit trail: EUIPO Official Journal records all registration and invalidity procedures; electronic application system retains complete submission and communication records; court judgments document unregistered design infringement case proceedings.
- **evidence_requirements**: Electronic signatures and system logs for EUIPO electronic communications; compliant image/3D model files for design representations; first disclosure date proof and infringement evidence (product photos, sales records) for unregistered design rights; EUIPO Official Journal records; electronic application system submission records; court judgment documents
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes
- Context: Regulation (EU) 2024/2822 was originally adopted on 2024-10-23 and published on 2024-11-18. This corrigendum is the 2nd correction (R(02)), primarily correcting text inconsistencies and technical errors in multilingual versions. The Community Design system covers both registered and unregistered protection, with this corrigendum affecting procedural and substantive provisions of both types.
- Unusual elements: (1) Article 86 title changed from "validity procedure" to "invalidity procedure", reflecting legal logic that this article deals with design right cancellation rather than validity confirmation. (2) Article 62(2) adds "identification method in electronic communication era", responding to EUIPO's comprehensive digitalization trend. (3) Corrigendum covers 14 corrections but only involves wording and technical adjustments without changing substantive legal obligations.
- Delegation boundary: EUIPO may further clarify procedural details through delegated acts under TFEU Article 290; Member State courts retain judicial discretion in determining unregistered design infringement.
- Accountability marker: EUIPO decisions must be issued in an identifiable manner via electronic communication system (Article 62(2) revision); litigation cost allocation clearly recorded in Article 70(2).
