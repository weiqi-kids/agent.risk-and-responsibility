## Notes

This corrigendum represents a terminology standardization rather than a substantive policy change. The underlying rights and obligations remain unchanged; only the official terminology has been updated to emphasize "remuneration" rather than "resale." This document was categorized under data_protection as the closest match among available categories, though it primarily concerns intellectual property rights in the art market. The corrigendum's immediate effect means no formal transposition deadline applies, but member states must update their legal texts to maintain consistency with EU law.
