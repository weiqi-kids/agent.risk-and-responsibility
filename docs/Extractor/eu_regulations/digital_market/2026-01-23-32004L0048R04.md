## Notes

This is a technical correction (corrigendum) to existing legislation, not a new substantive requirement. The change from "bodies for the management of collective rights" to "collective management bodies" aligns terminology within EU IP law framework.

Category selected as "digital_market" due to the intellectual property rights enforcement focus, which falls under broader digital economy and market regulation rather than data protection.

Original directive 2004/48/EC has undergone multiple technical corrections (this is R(04), indicating the fourth rectification), demonstrating the EU's practice of maintaining precise legal language across all official language versions.
