## Notes

This corrigendum corrects a technical citation error in the original 2001 regulation. Article 6 ter of the Paris Convention covers state emblems, official hallmarks, and symbols of public interest, while Article 6 bis covers protection of well-known marks. The correction ensures proper legal basis for design refusals involving official state symbols.

Document categorized under data_protection as closest match, though primary domain is intellectual property law. The correction affects administrative procedures for design registration across all EU member states.
