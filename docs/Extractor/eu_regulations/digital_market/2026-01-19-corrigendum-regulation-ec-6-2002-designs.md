## Notes
This is a corrigendum to the original Council Regulation (EC) No. 6/2002 on Community designs, published in OJ L 3, 5.1.2002. The document corrects six textual errors in the French language version published on 9 January 2026. This regulation concerns industrial design protection and intellectual property rights, not data protection, cybersecurity, or other enumerated categories in the eu_regulations layer. It may have been misclassified into the data_protection subdirectory and should be considered for exclusion from the system scope unless intellectual property regulations are to be included in the risk and responsibility framework. The corrected regulation remains directly applicable across all EU Member States without requiring national transposition.
