## Notes
The corrigendum does not concern the English version - correction applies to other language versions. This is primarily an administrative clarification affecting the interpretation of design rights scope. The change has implications for repair markets and right-to-repair initiatives by clarifying that maintenance and repair activities fall outside the definition of "normal use" under Community Design protection.
