## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Regulation
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable

- **rule_type**: Regulation
- **rule_id**: Council Regulation (EU) 2025/2618
- **effective_date**: 2025-12-19
- **issuing_body**: Council of the European Union
- **legal_basis**: Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 215
- **jurisdiction**: EU Member States
- **enforcement_authority**: Member State port authorities and maritime service providers
- **amendment_status**: Amends Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, adding 41 vessels to Annex XLII sanctions list

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Port authorities in EU Member States; maritime transport service providers; customs authorities; shipping operators accessing EU ports; vessel operators and owners of designated vessels
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **shift_summary**: Port authorities and maritime service providers must enforce prohibition on port access and maritime services for 41 newly designated vessels identified as transporting stolen Ukrainian grain and petroleum products through irregular shipping practices. Enforcement entities must update sanctions screening systems and deny services to listed vessels effective 19 December 2025.

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **Supply Chain Integrity**: Addition of 41 vessels to sanctions list expands due diligence obligations for maritime operators. Vessels designated for transporting stolen Ukrainian grain and petroleum products create sanctionable exposure for any entity providing port access or maritime services. Port authorities face operational risk if screening systems fail to identify newly listed vessels.
- **Compliance and Enforcement**: Member States must immediately enforce restrictions on designated vessels. Service providers risk penalties under underlying Regulation 833/2014 for inadvertent or deliberate provision of services to listed vessels. Enforcement authority fragmentation across 27 Member States creates potential compliance gaps.
- **Geopolitical and Operational Risk**: Regulation targets vessels participating in irregular shipping practices supporting Russian circumvention of Ukraine-related sanctions. Entities involved in grain supply chains face heightened scrutiny. Operational disruption risk for legitimate shippers if vessel identification errors occur during enforcement.

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: EU Member States must prohibit designated vessels from accessing EU ports and locks; maritime service providers must deny services to listed vessels; port authorities must screen vessel entries against updated Annex XLII effective 19 December 2025; entities providing port or maritime services must verify vessel status before service provision
- **evidence_requirements**: Member States must maintain records of denied port access; vessel identification verification documentation; enforcement actions taken against non-compliant service providers; sanctions screening system update logs demonstrating compliance with 19 December 2025 effective date
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory

## Notes

This amending regulation expands the sanctions vessel list under the established Russia-Ukraine sanctions framework. The regulation identifies 41 specific vessels (entries 565-605 in Annex XLII) based on evidence of transporting stolen Ukrainian grain and petroleum products through irregular shipping practices. The immediate entry into force date (19 December 2025) requires rapid operational response from port authorities and maritime service providers across all EU Member States. Enforcement relies on the penalty framework established in Regulation (EU) No 833/2014, which provides sanctions for violations including provision of services to designated vessels. The regulation does not contain transitional provisions, indicating expectation of immediate compliance. Supply chain operators in grain and petroleum sectors should verify vessel screening procedures to avoid sanctionable exposure.
