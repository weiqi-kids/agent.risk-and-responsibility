## Notes

This implementing regulation is part of the EU's targeted sanctions regime responding to human rights violations in Russia. The designation of a judge and prosecutor specifically relates to their roles in the prosecution and sentencing of individuals for exercising freedom of expression and association. Organizations should note that this is an expansion of an existing sanctions framework (Regulation 2024/1485), meaning infrastructure for compliance should already be in place. The key action is the immediate database update and re-screening of existing relationships. This regulation does not introduce new supply chain due diligence requirements but reinforces the importance of human rights considerations in sanctions designations, which may inform broader supply chain risk assessment frameworks.
