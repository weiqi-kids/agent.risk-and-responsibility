## Notes

This Decision reflects EU response to major restructuring in the battery and automotive supply chain. Northvolt's workforce reduction triggered the EGF mechanism, demonstrating the interplay between industrial policy, supply chain disruption, and labour market protection. While not imposing compliance obligations on private entities, it establishes a precedent for EU-level intervention when supply chain restructuring creates significant displacement. Organizations in sectors subject to rapid technological or economic shifts should monitor EGF activations as early indicators of systemic stress in their ecosystems.
