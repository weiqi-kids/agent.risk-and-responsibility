## Metadata
- **CELEX Number**: 32026R0249
- **Document Type**: regulation
- **Binding Force**: directly_applicable
- **Date of Adoption**: 2026-01-26
- **Date of Entry into Force**: 2026-01-31 (day following publication)
- **Publication Reference**: OJ L, 2026/249, 30.1.2026
- **ELI**: http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg/2026/249/oj
- **Legal Basis**: Article 43(3) TFEU
- **Amends**: Regulation (EU) 2025/202

## Objective
Establish scientifically-based catch limits and fishing effort restrictions for 2026-2028 to ensure sustainable exploitation of fish stocks in Union waters and by Union vessels in non-Union waters, implementing maximum sustainable yield (MSY) principles and landing obligation requirements.

## Key Provisions

### Fishing Opportunities Coverage
Establishes **Total Allowable Catches (TACs)** for 2026 and, where specified, for 2027 and 2028, alongside effort limitations and multiannual arrangements for certain stocks.

### Landing Obligation Integration
Recognizes that "**discarding is in principle no longer allowed**", requiring TACs based on total catch advice rather than landings-only figures for stocks under landing obligation restrictions.

### Scientific Basis
TACs must reflect "**best available scientific advice**" from International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES), incorporating:
1. Maximum sustainable yield (MSY) ranges
2. Biomass safeguards
3. Multiannual plan provisions (Regulations EU 2018/973 and 2019/472)

### By-Catch Management
Establishes specific TACs for unavoidable by-catches in mixed fisheries to prevent premature fishery closures while balancing stock conservation requirements.

### Notable Species Measures

#### European Seabass
- **Targeted fishing prohibition** with derogations for specific gear types
- **Recreational catch limits** specified

#### European Eel
- **Six-month commercial fishing closure**
- Limited derogations permitted for restocking purposes

#### Elasmobranchs (Skates/Sharks/Rays)
- **Zero catch recommendation implemented** for vulnerable elasmobranch species

### Regional Fisheries Management Organization (RFMO) Implementation
Implements recommendations from:
- North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC)
- International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT)
- Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR)
- Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)
- Other regional fisheries management organizations

### Amendment to Previous Regulation
Amends Regulation (EU) 2025/202 regarding blue whiting quota transfers between management areas.

## Risk & Responsibility Impact

### Shift Type
- expanded
- clarified

### Responsibility Changes

1. **Member States**:
   - Enforce TACs and fishing effort limitations within national waters
   - Allocate quotas to fishing vessels under national flag
   - Implement landing obligation monitoring and control
   - Monitor and report catches monthly to European Commission
   - Enforce species-specific restrictions (seabass, eel, elasmobranchs)
   - Ensure compliance with RFMO recommendations

2. **Fishing Vessel Operators**:
   - Comply with TAC limitations for each stock
   - Adhere to landing obligation (no discarding of regulated species)
   - Respect prohibited fishing areas and periods
   - Maintain catch documentation and logbook records
   - Comply with gear restrictions and technical measures

3. **European Commission**:
   - Monitor overall TAC utilization across Member States
   - Close fisheries when TACs exhausted
   - Assess scientific advice from ICES and RFMOs
   - Report to European Parliament and Council
   - Coordinate with third countries and RFMOs

4. **Control and Inspection Authorities**:
   - Conduct at-sea inspections and port controls
   - Verify landing obligation compliance
   - Enforce TAC closures and gear restrictions
   - Investigate infractions and impose penalties

### Enforcement Signal
- mandatory

### Sectors Affected
- Commercial fishing fleets
- Seafood supply chain (processing, distribution, retail)
- Aquaculture (eel restocking derogations)
- Recreational fishing (seabass restrictions)
- Port infrastructure and inspection services
- Coastal communities dependent on fishing

### Jurisdictional Applicability
**Member States Bound**: All coastal EU Member States
**EEA Relevance**: Yes (EEA Agreement Annex XIII covers fisheries cooperation; Norway and Iceland participate in TAC negotiations)
**Third Country Effect**: Affects third-country vessels fishing in Union waters under bilateral agreements; Union vessels fishing in third-country waters or RFMO areas

## Key Obligations

### Member State Obligations
1. Allocate national quotas to fishing vessels
2. Monitor catch levels and report monthly to Commission
3. Enforce landing obligation through control systems
4. Implement fishing closures when TACs reached
5. Enforce gear restrictions and technical measures
6. Cooperate with EFCA (European Fisheries Control Agency) inspections
7. Impose penalties for quota exceedances and landing obligation violations

### Fishing Operator Obligations
1. Comply with allocated quotas for each stock
2. Land all catches of regulated species (no discarding)
3. Maintain accurate logbooks and catch documentation
4. Respect prohibited areas and closed seasons
5. Use authorized fishing gear only
6. Submit to inspections by control authorities

### Commission Obligations
1. Monitor TAC utilization EU-wide
2. Issue fishery closure notifications when TACs exhausted
3. Coordinate with Member States on quota swaps and transfers
4. Assess scientific advice for future TAC recommendations
5. Report on implementation to European Parliament and Council

## Implementation Requirements

### Timeline
- **Entry into Force**: 2026-01-31 (day following publication)
- **Application Period**: 2026 (with specified provisions for 2027-2028)
- **Reporting**: Member States must provide monthly catch statistics

### Implementation Measures Required
1. **National quota allocation**: Member States distribute TACs to vessels and producer organizations
2. **Control systems**: Electronic reporting systems (ERS), vessel monitoring systems (VMS), remote electronic monitoring (REM)
3. **Landing obligation enforcement**: Port controls, observer programs, camera monitoring
4. **RFMO coordination**: Implementation of NEAFC, ICCAT, CCAMLR, IOTC recommendations
5. **Scientific monitoring**: Data collection for stock assessment and ICES advice

## Compliance Challenges
1. **Landing obligation enforcement**: Monitoring discards at sea remains technologically and operationally challenging
2. **Mixed fisheries management**: Unavoidable by-catches may cause "choke species" problems closing fisheries prematurely
3. **Quota allocation disputes**: National quota shares may not align with current fishing patterns
4. **Recreational fishing monitoring**: Seabass recreational catch limits difficult to enforce
5. **Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing**: Risk of quota exceedances through underreporting
6. **Climate-driven stock shifts**: Fish stocks moving northward due to warming waters complicate quota allocations
