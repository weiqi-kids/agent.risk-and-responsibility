## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Decision
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable

- **regulation_type**: Council Decision
- **legal_basis**: Treaty establishing the Energy Community, Article 24(1) and Article 47(2)
- **primary_driver**: Alignment of Energy Community environmental acquis with evolved EU biodiversity and water protection law
- **scope_summary**: Requires Energy Community contracting parties to implement four EU environmental directives for network energy activities, establishing biodiversity conservation and water quality standards for energy infrastructure projects
- **effective_date**: 2026-01-09 (published), implementation required within 5 years for contracting parties

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Energy Community contracting parties (non-EU states in southeastern Europe), energy infrastructure operators, renewable energy developers, hydropower facility operators, national environmental authorities, river basin management authorities
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **shift_summary**: Extends EU-level environmental protection requirements (Birds Directive 2009/147/EC, Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC, Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC and related water directives) to Energy Community member states, imposing site-based conservation obligations and water quality management requirements on network energy activities

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **primary_domain**: Environmental compliance in energy supply chain
- **cross_border_dimension**: Energy Community treaty framework binds non-EU states to EU environmental standards, creating transboundary regulatory alignment requirements
- **technology_dependency**: Moderate — requires environmental impact assessment systems, water body monitoring infrastructure, and biodiversity site management capabilities
- **regulatory_fragmentation_risk**: Medium — Five-year implementation window may create temporary divergence between EU and Energy Community environmental protection levels during transition period

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**:
  - Prohibit deliberate killing, capture, or disturbance of protected wild bird species during breeding periods (Directive 2009/147/EC)
  - Prevent deterioration of natural habitats and habitats of species of Community interest (Directive 92/43/EEC)
  - Ensure network energy activities do not cause deterioration of surface water and groundwater status (Directive 2000/60/EC)
  - Achieve good surface water status and good groundwater chemical status within river basin management planning cycles
  - Establish comprehensive water body monitoring systems with annual reporting
  - Classify all water bodies according to ecological and chemical status
  - Develop and update river basin management plans every six years
  - Implement derogation systems for protected species/habitats with strict justification requirements
  - Submit annual reports on derogation implementation to Energy Community Secretariat

- **evidence_requirements**:
  - Implementing legislation enacting directives within five years of decision adoption
  - Competent authority designation and notification within 5.5 years
  - Water body inventories with status classification
  - River basin management plans with monitoring program specifications
  - Annual derogation reports demonstrating no satisfactory alternative and compatibility with conservation objectives
  - Public availability of compliance reports through Energy Community Secretariat

- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory
  - Energy Community Secretariat oversight and reporting authority
  - Strict derogation justification requirements (must demonstrate no satisfactory alternative and compatibility with directive objectives)
  - Public transparency mechanism through report publication
  - Institutional monitoring framework rather than direct penalty provisions in this decision

## Notes

This decision expands the Energy Community Treaty's environmental acquis to align with current EU biodiversity and water protection law. The primary compliance burden falls on Energy Community contracting parties (non-EU states) rather than EU member states directly, but impacts EU-based energy companies operating infrastructure projects in Energy Community territories. The five-year implementation timeline creates a transitional period where network energy projects in these regions must prepare for stricter environmental standards comparable to EU requirements.

The decision's supply chain relevance stems from its impact on cross-border energy infrastructure and renewable energy supply chains extending into southeastern Europe and Energy Community member states. Organizations planning hydropower, transmission, or renewable energy projects in these territories must account for biodiversity site protection and water quality management obligations equivalent to EU standards.
