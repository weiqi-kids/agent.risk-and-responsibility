# Council Regulation (EU) 2026/266 - Fishing Opportunities for Mediterranean and Black Seas

## 基本資訊

**CELEX 編號**: 32026R0266

**官方公報**: OJ L, 2026/266, 30.1.2026

**通過日期**: 2026-01-26

**生效日期**: Upon publication (applicable from 2026-01-01 to 2026-12-31)

**法規類型**: **regulation**

**約束力等級**: **directly_applicable**

**法律基礎**: Article 43(3) TFEU; Regulation (EU) No 1380/2013 (Common Fisheries Policy)

## 規範主題

Establishes annual fishing opportunities (quotas and effort limits) for EU vessels exploiting fish stocks in Mediterranean and Black Sea waters, covering European eel, red coral, dolphinfish, demersal species, and small pelagics across GFCM geographic subareas.

## 責任轉移態樣

**轉移類型**: **clarified**

**執行信號**: **mandatory**

**受規範對象**:
- EU fishing vessels operating in Mediterranean and Black Sea
- Member States (effort allocation, monitoring, reporting)
- National authorities (enforcement of closures and catch limits)

**新增責任內容**:

1. **European Eel Protection**:
   - Mandatory six-month annual commercial fishing closure
   - Commercial glass eel fishing restricted to two months maximum with scientific monitoring
   - Complete prohibition on recreational eel fishing
   - Member States must designate closure periods and report by March 2026

2. **Fishing Effort Management**:
   - Maximum allowable fishing days for trawlers and longliners (by vessel size and zone)
   - Catch limits for deep-water shrimps and European hake in Western Mediterranean
   - Fishing effort ceilings for Adriatic demersal stocks
   - 180 fishing-day limit per vessel for Black Sea turbot

3. **Compensation Mechanism** (Article 8):
   - Member States may grant 3-37% additional fishing days to vessels implementing selectivity improvements
   - Measures include larger mesh codends, deep-water closures, juvenile/spawner protection
   - Requires national legislation adoption and Commission notification
   - Failure to report allocations after July 31, 2026 results in halved percentages

4. **Data Transmission Obligations**:
   - Recording and transmitting fishing effort data per Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 Articles 33-34
   - Use designated stock codes and effort group codes
   - Quarterly effort reporting by specified codes

5. **Precautionary Safeguards**:
   - Remedial measures when spawning biomass below safe limits (BPA/BLIM)
   - Catch limits for European hake using gillnets/trammel nets
   - Minimum conservation reference sizes (25mm carapace for Norway lobster)
   - Black Sea turbot closure period (April 15 - June 15)

## 實作時程與檢查點

**Member State Actions**:
- March 2026: Report eel closure periods and monitoring arrangements
- July 31, 2026: Deadline for reporting compensation mechanism allocations
- Quarterly: Fishing effort data transmission
- Ongoing: Management of fleet capacity ceilings and effort allocations

**Enforcement**: Standard mechanisms under Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 (Articles 105-107) for vessels exceeding allocated fishing days

## 風險與注意事項

**Compliance Risks**:
- Late reporting of compensation mechanisms reduces benefit by 50%
- Exceeding allocated fishing days triggers enforcement actions
- Insufficient scientific monitoring for glass eel fishing may require suspension

**Conservation Safeguards**:
- Fishing opportunities tied to FMSY ranges (Maximum Sustainable Yield)
- Year-to-year flexibility suspended for small pelagics and turbot (Articles 3-4 of Regulation EC No 847/96)
- Functional linkages: Turbot fishing restrictions necessary to avoid TAC reductions

**Accountability Mechanisms**:
- Commission oversight of Member State notifications
- Scientific review (STECF) requirements for selectivity measures
- On-site monitoring for vessels receiving compensation allocations
- Enhanced monitoring via scientific institutions for glass eel fishing

## 與其他法規的關聯

- **Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009**: Control, inspection, and enforcement
- **Regulation (EC) No 847/96**: Year-to-year quota flexibility (suspended for specific stocks)

## 原始內容摘錄

> "Member States shall ensure that fishing for European eel (Anguilla anguilla) in Union waters of the Mediterranean Sea is closed for a minimum of six consecutive months per calendar year."

> "The maximum allowable fishing effort for Union fishing vessels using trawls, dredges, similar towed gear, hooks and lines or similar gear and deploying demersal fish stocks..."

> "Member States may grant additional fishing days to Union fishing vessels... as a compensation for vessels applying measures that increase selectivity and reduce unwanted catches."

> "Without those measures, the TAC would have to be reduced to ensure recovery."
