## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Regulation
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable

- **type**: Regulation
- **effective_date**: 2025-12-30 (published in Official Journal)
- **status**: In force
- **trigger_condition**: Crisis or emergency mode declared under specific Union legal acts (Annex lists include public health emergencies, medical countermeasure regulations, internal market emergencies)
- **geographic_scope**: European Union internal market exclusively
- **affected_sectors**: Pharmaceuticals, medical devices, semiconductors for medical equipment, crisis-relevant products
- **rule_nature**: Emergency compulsory licensing mechanism allowing Commission to authorize use of patented inventions without rights-holder consent during officially declared crises

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Patent holders, potential manufacturers/licensees, customs authorities, national intellectual property offices, European Commission
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **shift_summary**: Commission gains authority to grant Union-level compulsory licenses during declared crises as "last resort" when voluntary agreements fail. Licensees must pay adequate remuneration, maintain records, restrict distribution to EU internal market only, and face enforcement through fines and export controls. Right holders retain consultation rights and remuneration claims but lose exclusive control during crisis periods.

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **intellectual_property_conflict**: Compulsory licenses override patent exclusivity during crises; right holders must accept involuntary licensing arrangements with government-determined remuneration
- **export_compliance**: Absolute prohibition on export of compulsorily licensed products; customs authorities empowered to suspend suspected non-compliant exports; licensees face fines for violations
- **crisis_dependency**: Entire mechanism only activates when crisis or emergency mode declared under specific legal acts; licenses automatically expire when crisis ends, creating uncertainty for long-term planning
- **procedural_ambiguity**: "Reasonable timeframe" and "adequate remuneration" not precisely defined; Commission sets advisory body consultation periods deemed "appropriate in view of circumstances"
- **voluntary_agreement_pressure**: Regulation establishes "last resort" principle requiring demonstration that voluntary licensing could not be achieved, potentially forcing rights holders into unfavorable pre-emptive agreements

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**:
  - Licensees must pay adequate remuneration to patent holders
  - Licensees must maintain records of manufactured quantities and provide capacity change information after license grant
  - Licensees must ensure products are identifiable, distinguishable, and restricted to EU internal market only
  - Licensees must refrain from export
  - Patent holders must participate in advisory body discussions when requested
  - Member States must report national compulsory licenses granted for crisis purposes to Commission
  - Customs authorities must conduct risk analysis and suspend suspected non-compliant exports

- **evidence_requirements**:
  - Commission must demonstrate voluntary licensing could not be achieved within reasonable timeframe before granting compulsory license
  - Licensees must document manufacturing quantities and capacity changes
  - Products manufactured under compulsory license must be identifiable and distinguishable from other products
  - Customs authorities must notify Commission of suspended exports; Commission determines compliance within 10 working days
  - Right holders may challenge licensee violations as intellectual property infringements

- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory
  - Commission authorized to impose fines and periodic penalty payments on non-compliant licensees
  - Customs enforcement through export suspension procedures
  - Court of Justice jurisdiction over validity of implementing acts under Article 263 TFEU
  - Limitation periods apply to fines and penalties
  - Right holders retain private enforcement rights for license condition violations

## Notes

This regulation amends Regulation (EC) No 816/2006 and establishes unprecedented Commission authority to override patent rights during officially declared crises. The "last resort" principle and automatic expiry provisions aim to balance emergency access needs with intellectual property protections, but definitions of "reasonable timeframe" and "adequate remuneration" remain subject to case-by-case Commission discretion. Export prohibition reflects internal market priority but creates potential tension with international access obligations. Voluntary licensing remains preferred pathway, with compulsory licensing as fallback when negotiations fail or crisis severity demands immediate action.
