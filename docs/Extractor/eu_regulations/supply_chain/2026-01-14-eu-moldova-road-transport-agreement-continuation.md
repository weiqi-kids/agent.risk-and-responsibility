**Shift Type**: Policy continuity (strategic extension)

**Shift Summary**: Authorizes continuation of EU-Moldova Road Transport Agreement through 31 March 2027, maintaining framework that has facilitated Ukrainian goods export via EU Solidarity Lanes during Russian military aggression. EU representatives may approve minor technical changes without additional Council approval. Requires renewal assessment minimum 3 months before expiration (by December 2026).

---

## Level 3: Risk Domains

- **Supply Chain & Logistics**: Maintains legal certainty for road freight operations between EU-Moldova, critical for Ukrainian export routes
- **Geopolitical**: Sustains Moldova trade support mechanism amid regional security instability from Russian aggression against Ukraine
- **Operational**: Road transport operators maintain permit framework and operational predictability through March 2027

---

## Level 4: Obligation, Evidence & Enforcement

### New Obligations
- **EU representatives** (in Joint Committee): Support continuation decision at next Joint Committee meeting; may approve minor technical amendments without further Council approval
- **Council**: Conduct renewal assessment no later than 3 months before agreement expiration (by December 2026)
- **Road transport operators** (EU and Moldova): Continue compliance with bilateral agreement framework (permits, technical standards, administrative procedures) through 31 March 2027
- **Member state authorities**: Maintain implementation of agreement provisions (border procedures, permit recognition) through extended period

### Evidence Requirements
- Joint Committee meeting minutes documenting continuation decision adoption
- Documentation of minor technical changes (if any) approved by EU representatives
- Operational data on road freight volumes/routes utilizing EU-Moldova agreement (to inform 2026 renewal assessment)
- Assessment report on agreement effectiveness in supporting Moldova and Ukraine Solidarity Lanes (due by December 2026)

### Enforcement Signal
- **Continuity priority**: Extension signals EU commitment to Moldova economic stability and Ukraine support infrastructure
- **Flexibility mechanism**: Pre-authorization for minor technical changes indicates EU preference for operational efficiency over bureaucratic process
- **Mandatory review**: Three-month advance assessment requirement ensures timely renewal decision (avoiding operational disruption)
- **No new penalties**: Extension maintains existing enforcement framework under bilateral agreement terms

## Notes

**Geopolitical context**: This extension is explicitly linked to Moldova's support role for Ukraine during Russian aggression, with the agreement serving as infrastructure for EU Solidarity Lanes (emergency export corridors for Ukrainian goods). Logistics operators should note the December 2026 assessment deadline as potential decision point affecting 2027+ operations.

**Operational implication**: Road freight companies operating EU-Moldova routes have operational certainty through Q1 2027, but should monitor renewal assessment outcome (expected Q4 2026) for 2027+ planning.
