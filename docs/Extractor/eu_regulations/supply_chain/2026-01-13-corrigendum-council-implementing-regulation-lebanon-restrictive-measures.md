## Notes
This corrigendum corrects technical errors in Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2025/1982 concerning Iran sanctions. The substantive impact extends beyond mere corrections: it adds comprehensive designation lists to Annexes VIII (nuclear/missile proliferation entities) and IX (IRGC-linked entities). The corrections include: (1) Recital 5 reference changed from "Annex VIII" to "Annexes VIII and IX"; (2) Article 1 updated to reflect both annexes amended; (3) Full annexes added with 43 designated natural persons and 60 designated entities. Organizations must treat this as a material sanctions update requiring immediate screening system updates, not merely a technical correction.
