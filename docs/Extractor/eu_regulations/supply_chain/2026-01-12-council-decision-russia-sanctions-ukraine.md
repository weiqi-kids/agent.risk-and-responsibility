## Notes

This decision expands the EU's restrictive measures against Russia by targeting the "shadow fleet" mechanism—41 vessels added to Annex XVI fall into three categories: (1) 4 vessels transporting stolen Ukrainian goods (grain and cultural property), (2) 36 oil tankers practicing irregular and high-risk shipping (AIS manipulation, flag state changes, irregular movement patterns), and (3) 1 vessel (GT HONOR) facilitating sanctions circumvention. The prohibition applies to vessel entry to ports and provision of any maritime services, creating enforcement obligations for port authorities and service providers. Decision took effect 19 December 2025, one day after publication.
