This document serves purely as an administrative correction to rectify formal designation errors in the original Council Regulation (EU) 2025/2614. The underlying regulation governs autonomous tariff quotas for specified agricultural and industrial products. Operators should ensure legal citations reference the correct instrument type ("Regulation" not "Decision") in documentation and compliance systems.
