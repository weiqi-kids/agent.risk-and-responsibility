**法律基礎**: Article 7(1) of Council Regulation (EU) 2023/1529 concerning restrictive measures related to Iran's military support to Russia and armed groups in Middle East/Red Sea

## 規範主題

Amends Annex III to Regulation (EU) 2023/1529 by designating four individuals and six entities involved in Iran's ballistic missile and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) programs that supply Russia's war effort.

## 責任轉移態樣

   - **Amir Radfar**: Director, Shahid Bagheri Industrial Group (SBIG) - manufactures solid-fuel ballistic missiles
   - **Hossein Hemsi**: CEO, Fanavaran Sanat Ertebatat Company (FSE) - supplies "critical electronic components and jam-resistance guidance systems" to IRGC programs
   - **Armin Ghorsi Anbaran**: Board Member, FSE - similar involvement in electronic component supply
   - **Hossein Bakshayesh**: CEO, Sahara Thunder - front company "supplies unmanned aerial vehicles to Russia"

2. **Designated Entities** (Six organizations):
   - **Sahara Thunder**: Import-export front for Iran's Ministry of Defence, transferring UAVs to Russia
   - **Fanavaran Sanat Ertebatat Company (FSE)**: Private supplier supporting UAV manufacturing

## 實作時程與檢查點

**Ongoing Compliance**:
- Financial institutions must screen transactions against updated Annex III
- Customs authorities monitor shipments involving designated entities
- Member States enforce asset freezes and transaction prohibitions

**No Grace Period**: Directly applicable regulation requires immediate compliance

## 風險與注意事項

**Supply Chain Risks**:
- Designated entities operate across procurement, manufacturing, and logistics networks
- Front companies (e.g., Sahara Thunder) may obscure beneficial ownership
- Port agents and ship management services facilitate sanctions evasion
- Electronic components and propellants have dual-use applications

**Compliance Challenges**:
- Identifying transactions with front companies requires enhanced due diligence
- Ship management and port agency services may involve multiple intermediaries
- Procurement networks span multiple jurisdictions beyond Iran

**Enforcement Priorities**:
- Ballistic missile components (ammonium perchlorate, guidance systems)
- UAV parts and complete systems destined for Russia
- Ship management services for sanctioned cargo
- Port agency services facilitating prohibited transfers

**Accountability Framework**:
- Listings target specific roles in procurement and production chains
