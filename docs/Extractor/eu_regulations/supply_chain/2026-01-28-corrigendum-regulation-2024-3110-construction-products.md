## Notes
WebFetch successful. This is a technical correction (corrigendum) to Regulation 2024/3110, modifying Recital 21 to replace "applications" (aanvragen) with "uses" (toepassingen) in Dutch version. The English version is unaffected. The original Regulation 2024/3110 repeals Regulation (EU) No. 305/2011.
