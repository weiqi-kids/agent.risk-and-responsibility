## Notes

This corrigendum represents a purely linguistic correction to ensure terminological consistency with the standardized control checklist instrument central to Directive 2022/1999's enforcement regime. The underlying directive itself is a codification consolidating 27+ years of amendments to the 1995 baseline framework, preserving existing Member State compliance obligations without substantive regulatory change.

The shift from "inspection report" to "control checklist" reflects the document's dual function: (1) standardized data capture tool for competent authorities, and (2) journey-level proof-of-check certificate for transport operators. This terminological precision reduces ambiguity in cross-border enforcement scenarios where vehicles transit multiple Member States during a single dangerous goods transport operation.

From a risk and responsibility perspective, the corrigendum's significance lies in its emphasis on procedural standardization across the Union's dangerous goods inspection regime. The control checklist serves as both compliance evidence and operational safeguard, preventing redundant inspections while ensuring harmonized risk assessment across 27+ Member State enforcement jurisdictions.

Member States already subject to Directive 95/50/EC transposition obligations face no additional implementation burden beyond administrative updates to align terminology in national legislation, enforcement guidelines, and inspector training materials with the corrected "control checklist" reference.
