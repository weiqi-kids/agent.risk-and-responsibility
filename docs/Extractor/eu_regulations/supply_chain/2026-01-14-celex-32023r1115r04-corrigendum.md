## L1 — Rule Signal

- **document_type**: Regulation
- **binding_force**: directly_applicable

- **rule_type**: Corrigendum (technical correction to existing regulation)
- **regulatory_origin**: European Union (EU)
- **source_regulation**: Regulation (EU) 2023/1115
- **original_publication**: Official Journal L 150, 9 June 2023
- **corrigendum_publication**: Official Journal L Series, 22 December 2025
- **primary_scope**: Deforestation and forest degradation linked to commodities placed on or exported from EU market
- **affected_commodities**: Cattle, cocoa, coffee, oil palm, rubber, soya, wood and derived products
- **signal_strength**: Medium (technical clarifications to existing obligations)

## L2 — Responsibility Structure

- **affected_roles**: Operators and traders introducing deforestation-linked commodities to EU market or exporting from EU; cattle producers maintaining breeding facilities
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: Five technical corrections to Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 clarifying geolocation coordinate precision requirements, conditional phrasing for market prohibitions, and terminology for livestock facilities. Changes improve implementation clarity without expanding substantive obligations.
- **organizational_impact**: Operators must ensure compliance systems interpret geolocation requirements with "at least six decimal digits" precision; cattle sector must track facility locations where animals are "maintained" rather than only initial breeding locations
- **governance_change**: No new governance structures; corrections refine existing due diligence and traceability requirements

## L3 — Risk Domains

- **primary_risk**: Supply chain compliance risk (misinterpretation of geolocation precision requirements)
- **secondary_risks**: Data accuracy risk (coordinate precision), documentation risk (cattle facility location tracking)
- **affected_sectors**: Agriculture, forestry, food processing, timber industry, cattle farming
- **geographic_scope**: European Union (all member states)
- **cross_border_implications**: Applies to imports into EU and exports from EU; requires due diligence on production locations globally

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence

- **new_obligations**: No new substantive obligations; corrections clarify existing requirements from Regulation (EU) 2023/1115 regarding geolocation coordinate precision (minimum six decimal digits for latitude/longitude), conditional market prohibitions, and livestock facility tracking terminology
- **evidence_requirements**: Operators must maintain due diligence documentation with geolocation data meeting six decimal digit precision standard; cattle sector must document all facilities where animals are maintained, not only initial breeding locations
- **enforcement_signal**: mandatory
- **compliance_timeline**: Corrections apply to original regulation's implementation timeline (29 December 2024 for most operators, 30 June 2025 for micro and small enterprises)
- **verification_mechanisms**: Unchanged from original regulation - competent authorities conduct checks on due diligence statements and supporting documentation

## Notes

This corrigendum addresses five technical errors in the Spanish language version of Regulation (EU) 2023/1115. Key corrections include:

1. Article 2(32): Clarifies geolocation coordinates must have "at least six decimal digits" (precision requirement)
2. Article 3(1): Adds conditional phrasing "when" for market prohibition conditions
3. Articles 9(1)(a)(iv) and Annex II: Changes "criadas" (bred) to "mantenidas" (maintained) for cattle facilities - expands tracking requirement to all locations where cattle are kept, not only breeding sites
4. Annex II: Clarifies geolocation requirements for cattle production locations

The substantive obligations remain unchanged from the original May 2023 regulation. However, these corrections may require operators to:
- Upgrade coordinate precision in tracking systems (if currently below six decimal digits)
- Expand cattle facility documentation to include all maintenance locations, not only breeding facilities
