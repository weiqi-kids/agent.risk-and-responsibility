## Notes

This decision is notable for its procedural history: the European Parliament initially postponed discharge on 7 May 2025, allowing the Agency time to address concerns, then granted discharge on 22 October 2025. This demonstrates the EU's accountability mechanism in action—identified issues trigger postponement, corrective action is implemented, and discharge is granted upon satisfactory resolution.

Organizations working with the EU Agency for Asylum should note this reflects well on the Agency's governance responsiveness. The specific concerns and corrective actions are detailed in the accompanying resolution (not provided in source material).
