**通過日期**: 2026-01-29

**生效日期**: Upon publication

**法規類型**: **decision**

**約束力等級**: **directly_applicable**

**法律基礎**: TEU Article 29; High Representative proposal

## 規範主題

Amends Decision (CFSP) 2024/2643 by adding six individuals to EU restrictive measures list targeting "Russia's destabilising activities" through information manipulation and propaganda supporting Ukraine conflict.

## 責任轉移態樣

**轉移類型**: **expanded**

**執行信號**: **mandatory**

**受規範對象**:
- Six Russian media personalities and cultural figures (natural persons)
- EU Member States (enforcement authorities)
- EU entities engaging with listed persons

**新增責任內容**:

1. **Designated Individuals** (Entry Date: 29 January 2026):

   - **Dmitry Viktorovich Guberniev**: TV presenter, sports commentator; advisor to Russia state channel
   - **Ekaterina Sergeevna Andreeva**: News anchor, "Vremya" program host since 1997
   - **Maria Eduardovna Sittel**: News anchor, "Vesti" program host since 2001
   - **Pavel Aleksandrovich Zarubin**: Journalist; "Direct Line with Vladimir Putin" host
   - **Roman Vasilyevich Chumakov**: Actor and singer
   - **Sergey Vladimirovich Polunin**: Ballet dancer, former academy rector

2. **Listing Basis** (Stated accountability grounds):
   - Responsibility for "information manipulation and interference"
   - "Supporting a violent conflict in a third country" (Ukraine) through propaganda activities

3. **Enforcement Implications** (Under EU sanctions framework):
   - Asset freezes for listed persons
   - Travel bans to EU territory
   - Prohibition on making funds/economic resources available to listed individuals
   - Due diligence requirements for entities with potential exposure

## 實作時程與檢查點

**Immediate Effect**: Decision entered into force upon publication (29 January 2026)

**Member State Obligations**:
- Implement asset freezes and travel bans immediately
- Update national sanctions databases with six new entries
- Notify financial institutions and border authorities

**No Phase-In Period**: CFSP decisions are directly applicable and binding

## 風險與注意事項

**Novel Targeting Approach**:
- First EU sanctions explicitly targeting **cultural and media figures** (actors, ballet dancers, sports commentators) for propaganda roles
- Expands sanctions beyond traditional military, political, and economic actors
- Reflects EU focus on countering information manipulation as strategic threat

**Accountability Basis**:
- Listings cite professional media roles (state TV anchors, program hosts)
- Cultural figures listed for public statements or affiliations supporting conflict
- All designations reference "supporting a violent conflict in a third country"

**Compliance Challenges**:
- Cultural figures may have international contracts and performance engagements
- Media personalities may travel for journalism or broadcasting activities
- Asset freeze extends to intellectual property royalties and performance fees

**Enforcement Priorities**:
- Monitoring entry attempts to EU territory
- Screening financial transactions for listed persons
- Reviewing cultural/media institutions for prohibited engagements

## 與其他法規的關聯

- **Decision (CFSP) 2024/2643**: Primary framework for Russia destabilising activities sanctions
- **TEU Article 29**: Legal basis for CFSP restrictive measures
- **EU Global Human Rights Sanctions Regime (EU Magnitsky)**: Parallel framework for human rights violations
