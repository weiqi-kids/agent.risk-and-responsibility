## What Changed

This decision approves the EU-Ukraine amending agreement extending the road freight transport framework originally established on 29 June 2022.

**Article 1** formally approves the amending agreement on behalf of the Union.

**Article 2** establishes temporal competence limits: The Union's exercise of shared competence "shall be limited to the period of application of the Agreement." Upon expiration, competence reverts to Member States.

**Article 3** directs the European Commission to notify Ukraine of Union consent to be bound by the agreement.

**Article 4** establishes immediate entry into force upon adoption (15 July 2025).

### Key temporal provisions of the underlying agreement:
- Original agreement extended "until 30 June 2025"
- Includes "possibility for a tacit renewal for one period of six months" (potential extension to 31 December 2025)

## Who Must Act

**European Commission**:
- Issue formal notification to Ukrainian government expressing Union consent to be bound
- Monitor implementation and compliance
- Administer Joint Committee mechanisms established under original agreement

**EU Member States**:
- Apply agreement provisions during its validity period
- Competence reverts to Member States upon agreement expiration
- Ensure road freight operators comply with bilateral framework

**Road freight transport operators (EU-Ukraine)**:
- Comply with agreement conditions during validity period
- Adjust operations based on extension timeline

**Joint Committee** (EU-Ukraine):
- Monitor agreement implementation
- Resolve compliance and interpretation issues
- Consider further extensions if needed

## Shift in Risk/Responsibility

**Shift Type**: clarified

**What responsibility is transferred/created**:
- EU maintains regulatory competence for road freight with Ukraine during agreement period (through 30 June 2025 with potential 6-month extension)
- Member States' regulatory powers explicitly limited during agreement validity
- Upon expiration, competence automatically reverts to Member States without further EU action
- Transport operators gain continued regulatory certainty for EU-Ukraine freight operations through at least mid-2025

**Enforcement Signal**: mandatory

**Justification cited**:
The decision ensures continued functioning of EU-Ukraine road freight transport by extending the 2022 agreement framework. While specific justification is not detailed in the decision text, context indicates support for Ukraine's economic connectivity during ongoing war with Russia.

Article 2's explicit temporal limitation ("shall be limited to the period of application of the Agreement") creates legal clarity on competence allocation, preventing indefinite EU exercise of shared powers.

## Related Framework

**Parent agreement**: Agreement between the European Union and Ukraine on the carriage of freight by road of 29 June 2022

**Related instruments**:
- EU-Ukraine Association Agreement (broader framework)
- Regulation (EC) No 1072/2009 on international road freight transport
- Council decisions on EU solidarity with Ukraine

**No explicit enforcement penalties detailed** - relies on Joint Committee dispute resolution mechanisms established under original 2022 agreement.
