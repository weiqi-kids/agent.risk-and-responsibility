## Level 3: Risk Domains

- **Compliance & Regulatory**: Financial institutions must update sanctions screening systems with enhanced designation details and specific risk indicators
- **Reputational**: Entities with ties to designated Guatemalan officials face enhanced scrutiny and potential association risk
- **Operational**: Organizations supporting Guatemala civil society must navigate hostile legal environment where judicial system is weaponized against independent media and anti-corruption actors

---

## Level 4: Obligation, Evidence & Enforcement

### New Obligations
- Member States must apply restrictive measures (asset freezes, transaction prohibitions) against updated Annex I designations
- Financial institutions must screen updated entries with enhanced due diligence on five designated individuals:

1. **María Consuelo Porras Argueta de Porres** (Attorney General of Guatemala)
   - **Reason**: Involvement in efforts to overturn 2023 election results; arbitrary proceedings against journalists, prosecutors, civil society

2. **Ángel Arnoldo Pineda Ávila** (Secretary-General, Public Ministry)
   - **Reason**: Facilitating spurious criminal investigations undermining election legitimacy as second-in-command

3. **José Rafael Curruchiche Cucul** (Head, Special Prosecution Office Against Impunity)
   - **Reason**: Leadership in investigations targeting ruling party and prosecution of corruption fighters

4. **Ricardo Rafael Méndez-Ruiz Valdés** (President, Foundation Against Terrorism)
   - **Reason**: Directing politically-motivated prosecutions against journalists and judges

5. **Raúl Amílcar Falla Ovalle** (Legal Representative, Foundation Against Terrorism)
   - **Reason**: Implementation of persecution campaigns against media and justice operators

- Compliance systems must flag transactions, accounts, or business relationships involving these individuals or their controlled entities
- Member state authorities must monitor and report sanctions implementation under base regulation framework

### Evidence Requirements
- Updated Annex I entries with specific factual allegations linking designated individuals to:
  - Spurious criminal investigations targeting electoral authorities, ruling party members, journalists, prosecutors
  - Efforts to overturn 2023 election results through judicial manipulation
  - Use of "Special Prosecution Office Against Impunity" and "Foundation Against Terrorism" as vehicles for politically-motivated legal actions
  - Persecution of independent media representatives and justice system operators
- Financial institution records of sanctions screening hits, blocked transactions, and frozen assets
- Member state reports on implementation and compliance enforcement actions

### Enforcement Signal
- **Direct applicability**: Binding throughout EU without member state transposition requirement enables immediate enforcement
- **Enhanced compliance expectations**: Detailed designation reasons provide financial institutions with specific risk indicators for enhanced due diligence (e.g., legal complaints from "Foundation Against Terrorism" may indicate politically-motivated action)
- **Penalties**: Violations subject to national sanctions enforcement penalties under EU restrictive measures legislation, including:
  - Asset freezes
  - Transaction prohibition enforcement
  - Criminal sanctions for sanctions evasion
  - Administrative penalties for compliance failures
- **Mandatory monitoring**: Member states report implementation through parent regulation (EU) 2024/287 framework

## Notes

This implementing regulation operates in parallel with Council Decision (CFSP) 2026/88 (same date), which updates the corresponding CFSP decision framework. The detailed designation reasons are significant for compliance purposes:

**Actionable intelligence for compliance officers**:
- **Foundation Against Terrorism**: Two designated individuals use this entity to file politically-motivated legal complaints. Organizations receiving legal actions from this foundation should conduct enhanced due diligence on legitimacy.
- **Special Prosecution Office Against Impunity**: Despite its name suggesting anti-corruption mandate, this office (led by designated individual Curruchiche Cucul) is being used to target corruption fighters and electoral authorities.
- **Attorney General's Office**: Under designated individual Porras, conducting spurious investigations against journalists and civil society rather than upholding rule of law.

**Risk indicator**: Entities receiving legal complaints, investigations, or prosecutions from these Guatemalan institutions should assess whether actions are politically-motivated versus legitimate law enforcement, particularly if targeting civil society, independent media, or electoral processes.

**Civil society context**: These sanctions target officials accused of weaponizing Guatemala's judicial system to undermine democratic institutions following contested 2023 elections.
