---

## Level 3: Risk Domains

- **Geopolitical & Regulatory Compliance**: EU escalates accountability pressure on Guatemala rule-of-law erosion, extending sanctions and updating evidence of democratic backsliding
- **Reputational & Operational**: Entities with Guatemala government ties face enhanced compliance scrutiny; civil society support networks navigating hostile prosecution environment

---

## Level 4: Obligation, Evidence & Enforcement

### New Obligations
- Member states must implement restrictive measures (asset freezes, travel bans) through 13 January 2027 (extended deadline)
- Update national sanctions lists with revised Annex entries detailing specific actions by five designated individuals:

1. **María Consuelo Porras Argueta De Porres** (Attorney General): Update sanctions entry to reflect "spurious criminal investigations" targeting electoral authorities, ruling party, independent journalists, and civil society

2. **Ángel Arnoldo Pineda Ávila** (Secretary-General, Public Ministry): Update entry noting involvement in "overturning results" of 2023 elections through questionable prosecutions

3. **José Rafael Curruchiche Cucul** (Head, Special Prosecution Office Against Impunity): Update entry citing leadership of investigations undermining electoral legitimacy

4. **Ricardo Rafael Méndez-Ruiz Valdés** (President, Foundation Against Terrorism): Update entry documenting "politically-motivated prosecutions" against journalists and judges

5. **Raúl Amílcar Falla Ovalle** (Legal Representative, Foundation Against Terrorism): Update entry noting targeting of media representatives and justice operators

- Financial institutions must screen updated designations and enhanced evidence descriptions
- Conduct review of restrictive measures framework no later than 13 January 2027

### Evidence Requirements
- Updated Annex entries with specific factual allegations (criminal investigations, election interference, persecution campaigns)
- Documentation linking designated individuals to:
  - Spurious criminal investigations targeting electoral authorities and ruling party
  - Efforts to overturn 2023 election results
  - Prosecutions against independent journalists, judges, prosecutors, civil society actors
  - Use of "Foundation Against Terrorism" as vehicle for politically-motivated legal actions
- Records of EU diplomatic engagement with Guatemala authorities on rule-of-law concerns
- Assessment reports on democratic backsliding and judicial independence erosion (to inform 2027 renewal decision)

### Enforcement Signal
- **Escalated enforcement**: One-year extension + detailed evidence updates signal EU assessment that Guatemala democratic backsliding is worsening, not improving
- **Enhanced compliance expectations**: Updated Annex descriptions provide financial institutions and member states with specific risk indicators for enhanced due diligence
- **Mandatory review**: 13 January 2027 deadline ensures reassessment of sanctions effectiveness and Guatemala situation
- **Penalties**: Violations subject to national penalties under EU restrictive measures legislation, including asset freezes and criminal sanctions for sanctions evasion

## Notes

This decision operates in parallel with Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2026/87 (same date), which updates the corresponding implementing regulation. The detailed Annex updates are significant: they move beyond generic sanctions language to cite specific actions (spurious investigations, election result interference, journalist persecution), providing compliance officers with actionable risk intelligence.

**Key risk indicator**: The Foundation Against Terrorism (two designated individuals) is being used as a legal vehicle for politically-motivated prosecutions—entities receiving legal complaints or investigations from this organization should conduct enhanced due diligence on legitimacy and potential political motivation.

**Civil society context**: The sanctions target individuals accused of weaponizing Guatemala's judicial system to suppress electoral legitimacy, independent media, and anti-corruption efforts following the 2023 elections.
