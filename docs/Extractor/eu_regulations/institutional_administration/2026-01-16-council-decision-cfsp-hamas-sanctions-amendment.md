## Notes

This decision operates in parallel with Council Implementing Regulation (EU) 2026/123 (same date), which updates the corresponding implementing regulation. The one-year extension indicates EU assessment that Hamas financing networks remain active and require sustained counter-measures. Financial institutions with Sudan exposure should prioritize compliance screening updates for the revised Hamas investment company network details.
