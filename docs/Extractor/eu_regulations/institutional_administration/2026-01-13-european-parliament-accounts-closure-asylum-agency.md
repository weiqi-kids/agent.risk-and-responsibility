## Level 4: Obligation, Evidence & Enforcement

### New Obligations

- **Executive Director**: Certify final account closure and ensure permanent preservation of audited financial statements

### Evidence Requirements

- Compliance documentation with:
  - Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 319

- **Audit trail**: Finalized accounts become permanent record for future audits, evaluations, and accountability reviews
- **No penalties**: Approval signifies satisfactory financial management; closure is administrative finalization

## Notes

This decision operates in tandem with Decision (EU) 2026/62 (budget discharge, same date). The two-decision structure reflects EU financial accountability framework:

1. **Discharge decision** (2026/62): Grants approval for budget implementation (executive accountability)
2. **Accounts closure decision** (2026/63): Approves finalization of financial records (administrative finality)

Both were adopted on the same date (22 October 2025, published 13 January 2026), completing the EU Agency for Asylum's 2023 accountability cycle. Organizations should note this is routine procedure for EU agencies, not an exceptional action.
