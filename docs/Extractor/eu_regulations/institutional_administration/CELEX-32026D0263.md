**Enforcement Signal**: mandatory

**Justification cited**:
Iran's direct military support to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine through:
- Supply of Shahed-series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used in strikes against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure
- Provision of ballistic missile components and propellant materials
- Establishment of front companies and port agents to facilitate military transfers
- Ongoing procurement networks supplying Russia's military operations

The decision targets the supply chain enabling Iran's material support to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, explicitly linking designations to "military support to Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine."
