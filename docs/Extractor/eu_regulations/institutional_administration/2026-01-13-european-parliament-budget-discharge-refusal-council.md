## Level 2: Strategic Shift Summary

**Affected Roles**: Secretary-General of the Council, European Council, Council of the European Union, European Commission (oversight), Court of Auditors

**Shift Type**: Accountability escalation (discharge refusal)

**Shift Summary**: European Parliament **refuses** to grant discharge to the Secretary-General of the Council for 2023 budget implementation (Section II: European Council and Council). This is an exceptional institutional accountability action indicating Parliamentary concerns about budget management, transparency, or compliance issues. Accompanying resolution (not included in this document) contains detailed observations requiring remedial action.

---

## Level 3: Risk Domains

- **Institutional Governance**: Discharge refusal signals serious Parliamentary concerns about Council budget management, potentially affecting inter-institutional trust
- **Compliance & Accountability**: Secretary-General faces formal disapproval requiring corrective measures before future discharge approval
- **Reputational**: Public record of discharge refusal affects Council institutional credibility

---

## Level 4: Obligation, Evidence & Enforcement

### New Obligations
- **European Parliament President**: Forward decision and accompanying resolution to European Council, Council, Commission, and Court of Auditors; publish in Official Journal L series
- **Secretary-General of the Council**: Address concerns outlined in accompanying resolution (document not provided but referenced); prepare remedial action plan; submit improved accounts/procedures for future discharge approval
- **Council institutions**: Implement corrective measures responsive to Parliamentary observations
- **Court of Auditors**: Monitor Council's remedial actions in subsequent audit cycles

### Evidence Requirements
- Consolidated annual accounts for financial year 2023 (COM(2024)0272)
- Court of Auditors' annual report on 2023 budget implementation
- Statement of assurance regarding account reliability and transaction legality
- Internal audit reports for European Council and Council (2023)
- Documentation of Parliamentary concerns (in accompanying resolution)
- Corrective action plans and implementation evidence (for future discharge consideration)

### Enforcement Signal
- **Exceptional accountability measure**: Discharge refusal is rare and signals serious concerns requiring high-level institutional response
- **No automatic financial penalties**: Discharge refusal does not trigger sanctions but requires corrective action before future approval
- **Inter-institutional pressure**: Formal public disapproval creates political and reputational pressure for remedial measures
- **Repeat review**: Secretary-General will face subsequent discharge procedures until concerns are resolved

## Notes

**[REVIEW_NEEDED]**

This document only contains the discharge refusal decision itself; the substantive concerns are detailed in the accompanying resolution (not provided in source material). The specific issues prompting refusal—which could range from audit findings, transparency concerns, procurement irregularities, or budget management weaknesses—are not identifiable from this decision text alone.

**Significance**: Discharge refusal is an exceptional institutional accountability tool. Organizations monitoring EU institutional governance should review the accompanying resolution when published to understand specific concerns affecting the Council's budget management practices.
