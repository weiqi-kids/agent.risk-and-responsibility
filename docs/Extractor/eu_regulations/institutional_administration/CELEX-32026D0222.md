## What Changed

This decision authorizes the European Commission to open negotiations with Australia for two distinct agreements:
1. Australia's participation in Union programmes (general framework)
2. Australia's association with Horizon Europe Pillar II (research and innovation specific)

**Article 1** grants Commission authority: "The Commission is hereby authorised to open negotiations, on behalf of the Union."

**Article 2** establishes negotiation framework: "The negotiations shall be conducted on the basis of the negotiating directives of the Council set out in the addendum to this Decision."

**Article 3** designates the Commission as the Union's negotiator.

**Article 4** requires consultation with two Council working parties:
- Asia-Oceania Working Party (general participation conditions)
- Research Working Party (Horizon Europe-specific terms)

## Who Must Act

**European Commission**:
- Lead negotiations with Australian government
- Conduct negotiations following Council directives (in addendum, not publicly disclosed)
- Consult with designated Council working parties throughout process

**Council working parties**:
- Asia-Oceania Working Party: Review general terms of Australia's participation in Union programmes
- Research Working Party: Review Horizon Europe association-specific provisions

**EU Member States**:
- Provide input through Council working parties
- Monitor negotiation progress
- Ultimately approve final agreement

## Shift in Risk/Responsibility

**Shift Type**: new

**What responsibility is transferred/created**:
- Commission assumes negotiation authority for international research cooperation agreement
- Australia (once agreement concluded) would gain access to Horizon Europe research funding and collaboration opportunities
- Australian entities would become subject to Horizon Europe participation rules and requirements
- EU research institutions would face increased international collaboration obligations with Australian partners
- Both parties would establish mutual financial contribution mechanisms for programme participation

**Enforcement Signal**: mandatory

**Justification cited**:
The decision enables "the participation of the Commonwealth of Australia in Union programmes and the association of the Commonwealth of Australia to Horizon Europe – the Framework Programme for Research and Innovation (2021-2027)."

This reflects EU strategy to enhance international research partnerships with like-minded democracies, expanding Horizon Europe's global reach while maintaining programme standards. Association agreements typically require third countries to contribute financially while gaining access to EU research funding and networks.
