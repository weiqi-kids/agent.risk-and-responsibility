## L1 — Rule Signal
- **rule_type**: guidance
- **issuing_body**: Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)
- **document_id**: CSA-Strata Identity Survey 2026
- **status**: final

## L2 — Responsibility Structure
- **affected_roles**: CISO, Identity and Access Management (IAM) Architects, Security Engineers, Enterprise Architects
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **shift_summary**: Organizations must expand IAM architectures beyond human-centric models to accommodate AI agents, as traditional IAM frameworks are insufficient for the scaling agentic workforce

## L3 — Risk Domains
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- AI Security
- Zero Trust Architecture

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence
- **new_obligations**:
  - Assess current IAM architecture capability to support AI agent identities
  - Develop identity frameworks that can scale with agentic workforce growth
  - Bridge the gap between human-centric IAM and AI agent identity requirements
- **evidence_requirements**:
  - IAM architecture assessment reports
  - AI agent identity management policies
  - Gap analysis between current and required IAM capabilities
- **enforcement_signal**: recommended

## Notes
Survey findings indicate a "time-to-trust" phase where enterprises recognize the need but lack mature frameworks. This represents industry consensus rather than regulatory requirement.
