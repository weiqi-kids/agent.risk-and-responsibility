## L1 — Rule Signal
- **rule_type**: guidance
- **issuing_body**: Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)
- **document_id**: N/A
- **status**: final

## L2 — Responsibility Structure
- **affected_roles**: Identity Governance Administrators, IAM Architects, Security Operations, Cloud Security Engineers
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: Traditional Identity Governance and Administration (IGA) systems designed for human identities with HR-anchored lifecycles are insufficient for the majority of modern identities which are non-human

## L3 — Risk Domains
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Non-Human Identity (NHI) Security
- Cloud Infrastructure Security

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence
- **new_obligations**:
  - Recognize limitations of IGA for non-human identities
  - Assess identity landscape beyond employee/contractor identities
  - Develop governance approaches suited for dynamic, non-HR-anchored identity lifecycles
- **evidence_requirements**:
  - Identity inventory including non-human identities
  - Gap analysis of IGA capabilities for NHI
  - Alternative governance approach documentation
- **enforcement_signal**: recommended

## Notes
Reflects shift in identity landscape where majority of identities are no longer human, challenging traditional IGA assumptions about identity lifecycle and management approaches.
