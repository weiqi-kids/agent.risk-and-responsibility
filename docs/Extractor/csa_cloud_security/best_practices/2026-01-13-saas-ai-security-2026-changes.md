## L1 — Rule Signal
- **rule_type**: guidance
- **issuing_body**: Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)
- **document_id**: N/A
- **status**: final

## L2 — Responsibility Structure
- **affected_roles**: Security Teams, SaaS Administrators, AI Security Officers, Identity Governance Teams
- **shift_type**: clarified
- **shift_summary**: AI adoption in 2025 followed traditional SaaS entry patterns (browser apps, OAuth, user-driven) rather than centralized deployment, while high-profile SaaS breaches exposed systemic security gaps requiring new approaches in 2026

## L3 — Risk Domains
- SaaS Security
- AI Security
- OAuth Integration Security
- User-Driven Adoption Risks

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence
- **new_obligations**:
  - Adapt security approaches for AI tools entering via SaaS patterns
  - Address systemic gaps exposed by 2025 SaaS breach wave
  - Manage user-driven AI tool adoption security risks
  - Implement controls for browser-based AI apps and OAuth integrations
- **evidence_requirements**:
  - SaaS and AI tool inventory (including user-driven adoptions)
  - OAuth integration security assessments
  - Incident response improvements post-2025 breaches
- **enforcement_signal**: recommended

## Notes
Reflects 2026 turning point where AI security challenges converge with SaaS security lessons from 2025 breach wave. AI tools entered enterprises through existing SaaS channels, not new centralized infrastructure, requiring security approach evolution.
