## L1 — Rule Signal
- **rule_type**: guidance
- **issuing_body**: Cloud Security Alliance (CSA)
- **document_id**: N/A
- **status**: final

## L2 — Responsibility Structure
- **affected_roles**: Security Engineers, Enterprise Architects, Business Leaders, Audit Teams, AI System Owners
- **shift_type**: expanded
- **shift_summary**: Autonomous and semi-autonomous AI systems executing real operations require proof of trust mechanisms, as existing identity, access, and audit protocols were designed for human-paced, human-supervised actions

## L3 — Risk Domains
- AI Security
- Trust Frameworks
- Identity and Access Management
- Audit and Compliance

## L4 — Obligation & Evidence
- **new_obligations**:
  - Develop proof of AI trust mechanisms beyond traditional security
  - Adapt identity, access, and audit protocols for autonomous AI pace
  - Build confidence in foundations as AI systems touch real systems and data
  - Establish governance for AI calling APIs, managing workflows, accessing financial systems
- **evidence_requirements**:
  - AI trust framework documentation
  - Audit trails for autonomous AI actions
  - Access control implementations for AI systems
  - Trust validation mechanisms for AI operations
- **enforcement_signal**: recommended

## Notes
Reflects reality that autonomous AI systems operate at pace and scale beyond human team capacity. Traditional security protocols assumed human supervision and human-paced actions, creating fundamental gap for agentic systems.
