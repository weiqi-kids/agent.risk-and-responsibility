## Notes
官方ISO標準資料，confidence為高。ISO標準為自願性標準，但某些行業或法規可能要求遵循。

**標準範圍**: This document specifies a common, interoperable set of extensible properties for the description of resource content, functionality, user needs and preferences, to enable network-supported individualization of resources, services and environments to match the unique needs and preferences of the individual.This document includes all relevant mechanisms for the publication of terminology for such descriptions, including publicly available registries of properties and related metadata resources such as application profiles.This document takes an inclusive approach to individualization, since any user can experience a mismatch of their individual needs and preferences and the content or services delivered; it is not restricted to descriptions related to stereotypical notions of disability. It provides properties for describing access attributes of resources. It does not ascribe medical conditions to such properties (e.g. ‘non-visual’ as a property value does not infer visual disability, as when the user’s eyes are busy watching the road).This document defines a set of core Access for All (AfA) properties that can be used in a digital resource description (DRD), an AfA record, and equally in a stored personal needs and preferences profile, also an AfA record. It also includes how to extend or add a property or its value using an application profile as defined by ISO/IEC 19788-1.
