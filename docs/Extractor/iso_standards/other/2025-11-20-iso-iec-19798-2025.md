## Notes
官方ISO標準資料，confidence為高。ISO標準為自願性標準，但某些行業或法規可能要求遵循。

**標準範圍**: This document is limited to the evaluation of toner cartridge page yield for toner-containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and toner cartridges without a photoconductor) for colour electrophotographic print systems. This document can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device that has a digital input printing path, including multi-function devices that contain electrophotographic printer components.This document is only intended for the measurement of toner cartridge page yield when printing on plain paper using cyan, magenta, yellow and black toner cartridges. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.This document is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to or greater than A3 or for photo-only printers.Application of this document for yield measurement of toner replenishment systems (i.e. toner cartridge and bottle type systems where the toner reservoir is internal to the printing system and not user-replaceable) implies some procedural modifications specifically noted herein. This document is intended for equipment used in the office space and does not apply to production volume or large format printing machines where the major cost of ownership is not caused by the consumable yield measured in this document.NOTE 1        An all-in-one toner cartridge is a cartridge that includes at least: a toner containment part, a photoreceptor part and a developer part (see ISO/IEC 29142-1).NOTE 2        This document will be used for the measurement of one of the contributions to cost per page (CPP). This document does not directly measure CPP, only the yield of the magenta, cyan, yellow and black toner cartridges. In most cases, these are not the only contributors to the CPP. It is beyond the scope of this document to provide a methodology for calculation of CPP.
