**標準範圍**: This document gives guidance relating to successful, secure and usable implementation of biometric enrolment processes, while indicating risk factors that organizations which use biometric technologies can address during procurement, design, deployment and operation. Much of this document is generic to many types of applications, e.g. from national scale commercial and government applications, to closed systems for in-house operations, and to consumer applications. However, the intended application and its purpose often have influence on the necessary enrolment data quality and are taken into account when specifying an enrolment system and process.This document specifies the differences in operation relating to specific types of application, e.g. where self-enrolment is more appropriate than attended enrolment. This document focuses on mandatory, attended enrolment at fixed locations. It ultimately consolidates information relating to better practices for the implementation of biometric enrolment capability in various business contexts including considerations of process, function (system), and technology, as well as legal/privacy and policy aspects.This document provides guidance on collection and storage of biometric enrolment data and the impact on dependent processes of verification and identification. This document does not include material specific to forensic and law enforcement applications.
