# ISO 27799:2025 — Health informatics — Information security controls in health based on ISO/IEC 27002

## L1: 基本資訊（必填）

**title**: Health informatics — Information security controls in health based on ISO/IEC 27002
**iso_refno**: ISO 27799:2025
**edition**: 3
**date**: 2025-12-18
**ics_code**: 35.030, 35.240.80
**technical_committee**: ISO/TC 215
**source_layer**: iso_standards
**original_content**: This document provides information security controls, including implementation guidance, for health organizations. It is based on ISO/IEC 27002:2022. In addition to generic ICT equipment and software used in many other environments, the scope of this document includes software and systems specifically for healthcare, such as electronic health record systems and medical devices incorporating health software. Such medical devices can be programmed or programmable and can contain software, firmware or both. Other digital equipment (such as that for environmental and infection control, building management, and physical security), which can be used in premises where healthcare is provided, is also in scope. This document applies to information in all its aspects, whatever form the information takes (including text and numbers, sound recordings, drawings, images and video), by whatever means it has been acquired or captured, whatever means are used to store it (such as printing or writing on paper or storage electronically), and whatever means are used to transfer or exchange it (orally, by hand, by post, movement of storage media, direct links or networking). This document is for organizations of all types and sizes that provide healthcare or are custodians of personal health information for other reasons. The information that they are responsible for can be stored and processed in many possible ways and locations, including on premises or in the cloud, but remains in scope. This document applies to all physical settings where healthcare is intended to be delivered, such as hospitals, clinics and other locations or facilities designated for healthcare purposes such as ambulances and mobile imaging or diagnostic units. It also applies to care provided elsewhere, such as in residential premises. In addition to the range of settings, this document applies to all methods of service provision including remote or virtual healthcare.

## L2: 責任轉移判定（必填）

**shift_type**: clarified
**enforcement_signal**: recommended
**rule_type**: Published
**affected_party**: Healthcare organizations, health IT vendors, medical device manufacturers
**explanation**: 此為第 3 版標準，基於 ISO/IEC 27002:2022 提供醫療組織的資訊安全控制措施和實施指引。涵蓋範圍極廣，包括電子健康記錄系統、含健康軟體的醫療器材、環境控制設備等。適用於所有資訊形式（文字、影像、錄音等）和儲存方式（紙本或電子），以及所有醫療服務場所（醫院、診所、救護車、遠距醫療等）。

## L3: 歷史脈絡（選填）

**replaces**: ISO 27799:2016 (standard/61347), ISO 27799:2016/Amd 1:2021 (standard/62777)
**context**: ISO 27799 首版於 2008 年發布，此次第 3 版更新與 ISO/IEC 27002:2022 的重大改版同步，反映了雲端運算、遠距醫療、物聯網醫療器材等新技術帶來的安全挑戰。在 COVID-19 疫情後，遠距醫療和數位健康服務快速發展，本標準的更新尤為及時。

## L4: 連動影響（選填）

**related_shifts**:
- ISO/IEC 27002:2022（資訊安全控制措施）— 核心依賴
- ISO/IEC 27001（資訊安全管理系統）— ISMS 實施互補
- HIPAA（美國健康資料隱私法）— 法規遵循支援
- GDPR（一般資料保護規範）— 健康資料保護協調

**cross_domain_impact**: 對電子病歷系統、醫療器材軟體、遠距醫療平台、健康雲端服務都有重大影響。強化了醫療組織的資訊安全防護能力，支援跨境健康資料交換和醫療器材網路安全認證。
