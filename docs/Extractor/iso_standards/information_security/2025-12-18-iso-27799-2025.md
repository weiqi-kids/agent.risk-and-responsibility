**標準範圍**: This document provides information security controls, including implementation guidance, for health organizations. It is based on ISO/IEC 27002:2022In addition to generic ICT equipment and software used in many other environments, the scope of this document includes software and systems specifically for healthcare, such as electronic health record systems and medical devices incorporating health software. Such medical devices can be programmed or programmable and can contain software, firmware or both.Other digital equipment (such as that for environmental and infection control, building management, and physical security), which can be used in premises where healthcare is provided, is also in scope.This document applies to information in all its aspects, whatever form the information takes (including text and numbers, sound recordings, drawings, images and video), by whatever means it has been acquired or captured, whatever means are used to store it (such as printing or writing on paper or storage electronically), and whatever means are used to transfer or exchange it (orally, by hand, by post, movement of storage media, direct links or networking).This document is for organizations of all types and sizes that provide healthcare or are custodians of personal health information for other reasons. The information that they are responsible for can be stored and processed in many possible ways and locations, including on premises or in the cloud, but remains in scope.This document applies to all physical settings where healthcare is intended to be delivered, such as hospitals, clinics and other locations or facilities designated for healthcare purposes such as ambulances and mobile imaging or diagnostic units. It also applies to care provided elsewhere, such as in residential premises. In addition to the range of settings, this document applies to all methods of service provision including remote or virtual healthcare.
